The given equation is $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$.
We are looking for integer solutions $(x,y)$ such that $-100 \le x \le 100$ and $-100 \le y \le 100$.

First, we can factor the quadratic expression $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2$. We look for factors of the form $(ax+by)(cx+dy)$.
We need $ac=12$, $bd=-6$, and $ad+bc=-1$.
Let's try $a=3$ and $c=4$. Then $3d+4b=-1$.
Let's try $b=2$. Then $3d+4(2)=-1 \implies 3d+8=-1 \implies 3d=-9 \implies d=-3$.
Check $bd = (2)(-3) = -6$. This works.
So the factorization is $(3x+2y)(4x-3y)=0$.

This equation holds if and only if $3x+2y = 0$ or $4x-3y = 0$.
We analyze these two cases.

Case 1: $3x+2y = 0$.
This implies $2y = -3x$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x$ must be an even integer. Let $x = 2k$ for some integer $k$.
Then $2y = -3(2k) = -6k$, so $y = -3k$.
The integer solutions are of the form $(x,y) = (2k, -3k)$.
We need to find the values of $k$ for which these solutions satisfy the constraints $-100 \le x \le 100$ and $-100 \le y \le 100$.
$-100 \le x \le 100 \implies -100 \le 2k \le 100 \implies -50 \le k \le 50$.
$-100 \le y \le 100 \implies -100 \le -3k \le 100$. Dividing by $-3$ and reversing the inequalities, we get $\frac{100}{-3} \le k \le \frac{-100}{-3}$.
This simplifies to $-33.33... \le k \le 33.33...$.
Since $k$ must be an integer, we have $-33 \le k \le 33$.
To satisfy both constraints, $k$ must be in the intersection of $[-50, 50]$ and $[-33, 33]$.
The intersection is $[-33, 33]$.
The number of integers in this range is $33 - (-33) + 1 = 33 + 33 + 1 = 67$.
So there are 67 solutions in Case 1.

Case 2: $4x-3y = 0$.
This implies $3y = 4x$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x$ must be a multiple of 3. Let $x = 3k$ for some integer $k$.
Then $3y = 4(3k) = 12k$, so $y = 4k$.
The integer solutions are of the form $(x,y) = (3k, 4k)$.
We need to find the values of $k$ for which these solutions satisfy the constraints $-100 \le x \le 100$ and $-100 \le y \le 100$.
$-100 \le x \le 100 \implies -100 \le 3k \le 100 \implies -100/3 \le k \le 100/3$.
This simplifies to $-33.33... \le k \le 33.33...$.
Since $k$ must be an integer, we have $-33 \le k \le 33$.
$-100 \le y \le 100 \implies -100 \le 4k \le 100 \implies -100/4 \le k \le 100/4$.
This simplifies to $-25 \le k \le 25$.
To satisfy both constraints, $k$ must be in the intersection of $[-33, 33]$ and $[-25, 25]$.
The intersection is $[-25, 25]$.
The number of integers in this range is $25 - (-25) + 1 = 25 + 25 + 1 = 51$.
So there are 51 solutions in Case 2.

We have found the number of solutions for each case. However, we must check if there is any overlap between the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2.
A solution $(x,y)$ would be in both sets if it satisfies both $3x+2y=0$ and $4x-3y=0$.
From $3x+2y=0$, we have $y = -3x/2$.
Substitute this into the second equation: $4x - 3(-3x/2) = 0$.
$4x + 9x/2 = 0$.
$8x/2 + 9x/2 = 0$.
$17x/2 = 0$, which implies $x=0$.
If $x=0$, then $y = -3(0)/2 = 0$.
So the only common solution is $(x,y) = (0,0)$.

Let's check if $(0,0)$ is included in the counts for Case 1 and Case 2.
In Case 1, $(x,y)=(2k, -3k)$. If $(x,y)=(0,0)$, then $2k=0$ and $-3k=0$, which means $k=0$. The range for $k$ in Case 1 is $[-33, 33]$, which includes $k=0$. So $(0,0)$ is counted in the 67 solutions.
In Case 2, $(x,y)=(3k, 4k)$. If $(x,y)=(0,0)$, then $3k=0$ and $4k=0$, which means $k=0$. The range for $k$ in Case 2 is $[-25, 25]$, which includes $k=0$. So $(0,0)$ is counted in the 51 solutions.

Since $(0,0)$ is counted in both sets, we have double counted it. To find the total number of unique solutions, we add the number of solutions from each case and subtract the number of common solutions.
Total number of solutions = (Number of solutions from Case 1) + (Number of solutions from Case 2) - (Number of common solutions)
Total number of solutions = $67 + 51 - 1$.
$67 + 51 = 118$.
$118 - 1 = 117$.

Thus, there are 117 ordered pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy the given conditions.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{117}$

The equation given is $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$.
This is a homogeneous quadratic equation in two variables $x$ and $y$. We can factor the quadratic expression.
We look for two numbers whose sum is $-1$ and whose product is $12 \times (-6) = -72$. These numbers are $-9$ and $8$.
So we can rewrite the middle term $-xy$ as $-9xy + 8xy$.
$12x^2 - 9xy + 8xy - 6y^2 = 0$
Factor by grouping:
$3x(4x - 3y) + 2y(4x - 3y) = 0$
$(3x + 2y)(4x - 3y) = 0$
This equation holds if and only if $3x + 2y = 0$ or $4x - 3y = 0$.

We are looking for integer pairs $(x,y)$ such that $-100 \le x \le 100$ and $-100 \le y \le 100$.
Let $S_1$ be the set of pairs $(x,y)$ satisfying $3x + 2y = 0$ and the range constraints.
Let $S_2$ be the set of pairs $(x,y)$ satisfying $4x - 3y = 0$ and the range constraints.
The total number of solutions is $|S_1 \cup S_2| = |S_1| + |S_2| - |S_1 \cap S_2|$.

Case 1: $3x + 2y = 0$.
This implies $3x = -2y$. Since 3 and -2 are coprime, $x$ must be a multiple of -2, and $y$ must be a multiple of 3.
Let $x = -2k$ for some integer $k$.
Substituting into the equation: $3(-2k) = -2y \implies -6k = -2y \implies y = 3k$.
So the integer solutions are of the form $(x,y) = (-2k, 3k)$ for $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
We need to find the values of $k$ such that $x$ and $y$ are within the range $[-100, 100]$.
$-100 \le x \le 100 \implies -100 \le -2k \le 100$. Dividing by -2 and reversing the inequalities gives $50 \ge k \ge -50$.
$-100 \le y \le 100 \implies -100 \le 3k \le 100$. Dividing by 3 gives $-100/3 \le k \le 100/3$, which is approximately $-33.33 \le k \le 33.33$.
Since $k$ must be an integer, we have $-33 \le k \le 33$.
For $k$ to satisfy both conditions, it must be in the intersection of $[-50, 50]$ and $[-33, 33]$, which is $[-33, 33]$.
The number of integers in this range is $33 - (-33) + 1 = 33 + 33 + 1 = 67$.
So, $|S_1| = 67$.

Case 2: $4x - 3y = 0$.
This implies $4x = 3y$. Since 4 and 3 are coprime, $x$ must be a multiple of 3, and $y$ must be a multiple of 4.
Let $x = 3m$ for some integer $m$.
Substituting into the equation: $4(3m) = 3y \implies 12m = 3y \implies y = 4m$.
So the integer solutions are of the form $(x,y) = (3m, 4m)$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}$.
We need to find the values of $m$ such that $x$ and $y$ are within the range $[-100, 100]$.
$-100 \le x \le 100 \implies -100 \le 3m \le 100$. Dividing by 3 gives $-100/3 \le m \le 100/3$, which is approximately $-33.33 \le m \le 33.33$.
Since $m$ must be an integer, we have $-33 \le m \le 33$.
$-100 \le y \le 100 \implies -100 \le 4m \le 100$. Dividing by 4 gives $-100/4 \le m \le 100/4$, which is $-25 \le m \le 25$.
For $m$ to satisfy both conditions, it must be in the intersection of $[-33, 33]$ and $[-25, 25]$, which is $[-25, 25]$.
The number of integers in this range is $25 - (-25) + 1 = 25 + 25 + 1 = 51$.
So, $|S_2| = 51$.

Intersection $S_1 \cap S_2$:
We need pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy both $3x + 2y = 0$ and $4x - 3y = 0$.
From $3x = -2y$, we have $y = -3x/2$.
Substitute this into the second equation: $4x - 3(-3x/2) = 0$.
$4x + 9x/2 = 0$.
Multiply by 2: $8x + 9x = 0 \implies 17x = 0 \implies x = 0$.
Substitute $x=0$ back into $y = -3x/2$: $y = -3(0)/2 = 0$.
The only integer pair satisfying both equations is $(0,0)$.
We check the range constraints: $-100 \le 0 \le 100$. So $(0,0)$ is a valid solution.
$S_1 \cap S_2 = \{(0,0)\}$.
So, $|S_1 \cap S_2| = 1$.

Finally, we calculate the total number of distinct solutions using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:
$|S_1 \cup S_2| = |S_1| + |S_2| - |S_1 \cap S_2| = 67 + 51 - 1 = 118 - 1 = 117$.

The number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ is 117.

Final check:
Solutions of type $(-2k, 3k)$ for $k \in [-33, 33]$. Examples: $(-66, 99)$, $(0,0)$, $(66, -99)$. Total 67.
Solutions of type $(3m, 4m)$ for $m \in [-25, 25]$. Examples: $(75, 100)$, $(0,0)$, $(-75, -100)$. Total 51.
The solution $(0,0)$ is generated by $k=0$ in the first set and by $m=0$ in the second set. It is the only common solution.
Total number of distinct solutions = $67 + 51 - 1 = 117$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{117}$















The given equation is $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$. We are looking for the number of ordered pairs of integers $(x, y)$ such that $-100 \le x \le 100$ and $-100 \le y \le 100$.

This is a homogeneous equation. We can factor it by treating it as a quadratic equation in terms of one variable, say $x$.
$12x^2 - (y)x - (6y^2) = 0$.
We can use the quadratic formula to find $x$ in terms of $y$:
$x = \frac{-(-y) \pm \sqrt{(-y)^2 - 4(12)(-6y^2)}}{2(12)} = \frac{y \pm \sqrt{y^2 + 288y^2}}{24}$
$x = \frac{y \pm \sqrt{289y^2}}{24} = \frac{y \pm 17|y|}{24}$.

We consider two cases based on the sign of $y$.
Case 1: $y \ge 0$. Then $|y| = y$.
$x = \frac{y \pm 17y}{24}$.
$x_1 = \frac{y + 17y}{24} = \frac{18y}{24} = \frac{3y}{4}$.
$x_2 = \frac{y - 17y}{24} = \frac{-16y}{24} = \frac{-2y}{3}$.

Case 2: $y < 0$. Then $|y| = -y$.
$x = \frac{y \pm 17(-y)}{24}$.
$x_1 = \frac{y - 17y}{24} = \frac{-16y}{24} = \frac{-2y}{3}$.
$x_2 = \frac{y + 17y}{24} = \frac{18y}{24} = \frac{3y}{4}$.

In both cases, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ must be either $x = \frac{3y}{4}$ or $x = \frac{-2y}{3}$.
These equations can be rewritten as $4x = 3y$ and $3x = -2y$.
So the original equation $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$ can be factored as $(4x - 3y)(3x + 2y) = 0$.
The set of integer solutions $(x, y)$ is the union of the sets of solutions for $4x - 3y = 0$ and $3x + 2y = 0$.

Let $S_1$ be the set of integer solutions to $4x = 3y$ such that $-100 \le x \le 100$ and $-100 \le y \le 100$.
Since 4 and 3 are coprime, $x$ must be a multiple of 3 and $y$ must be a multiple of 4. Let $x = 3k$ for some integer $k$.
Then $4(3k) = 3y$, which simplifies to $12k = 3y$, so $y = 4k$.
The solutions are of the form $(x, y) = (3k, 4k)$.
We need to find the values of $k$ such that the constraints are satisfied:
$-100 \le x \le 100 \implies -100 \le 3k \le 100$. Dividing by 3 gives $-33.33... \le k \le 33.33...$. Since $k$ must be an integer, $-33 \le k \le 33$.
$-100 \le y \le 100 \implies -100 \le 4k \le 100$. Dividing by 4 gives $-25 \le k \le 25$. Since $k$ must be an integer, $-25 \le k \le 25$.
For a pair $(3k, 4k)$ to be a solution, $k$ must satisfy both conditions. Thus, $k$ must be in the intersection of the ranges $[-33, 33]$ and $[-25, 25]$. The intersection is $[-25, 25]$.
The number of integers in the range $[-25, 25]$ is $25 - (-25) + 1 = 51$.
So, $|S_1| = 51$.

Let $S_2$ be the set of integer solutions to $3x = -2y$ such that $-100 \le x \le 100$ and $-100 \le y \le 100$.
Since 3 and -2 are coprime, $x$ must be a multiple of 2 and $y$ must be a multiple of 3. Let $x = -2k$ for some integer $k$.
Then $3(-2k) = -2y$, which simplifies to $-6k = -2y$, so $y = 3k$.
The solutions are of the form $(x, y) = (-2k, 3k)$.
We need to find the values of $k$ such that the constraints are satisfied:
$-100 \le x \le 100 \implies -100 \le -2k \le 100$. Dividing by -2 (and reversing the inequalities) gives $50 \ge k \ge -50$. So $-50 \le k \le 50$.
$-100 \le y \le 100 \implies -100 \le 3k \le 100$. Dividing by 3 gives $-33.33... \le k \le 33.33...$. Since $k$ must be an integer, $-33 \le k \le 33$.
For a pair $(-2k, 3k)$ to be a solution, $k$ must satisfy both conditions. Thus, $k$ must be in the intersection of the ranges $[-50, 50]$ and $[-33, 33]$. The intersection is $[-33, 33]$.
The number of integers in the range $[-33, 33]$ is $33 - (-33) + 1 = 67$.
So, $|S_2| = 67$.

The total number of solutions is the size of the union $S_1 \cup S_2$. We use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion: $|S_1 \cup S_2| = |S_1| + |S_2| - |S_1 \cap S_2|$.
We need to find the intersection $S_1 \cap S_2$, which contains pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both $4x = 3y$ and $3x = -2y$.
Substitute $y = \frac{4}{3}x$ from the first equation into the second equation:
$3x = -2(\frac{4}{3}x)$
$3x = -\frac{8}{3}x$
$9x = -8x$
$17x = 0$, which implies $x = 0$.
If $x = 0$, then $4(0) = 3y \implies 3y = 0 \implies y = 0$.
The only solution in the intersection is $(0, 0)$.
Let's check if $(0, 0)$ is in both sets $S_1$ and $S_2$.
For $S_1$: $(3k, 4k) = (0, 0)$ implies $k=0$. The range for $k$ is $[-25, 25]$, which includes $k=0$.
For $S_2$: $(-2k, 3k) = (0, 0)$ implies $k=0$. The range for $k$ is $[-33, 33]$, which includes $k=0$.
So, $S_1 \cap S_2 = \{(0, 0)\}$, and $|S_1 \cap S_2| = 1$.

Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:
Total number of pairs = $|S_1| + |S_2| - |S_1 \cap S_2| = 51 + 67 - 1 = 118 - 1 = 117$.

Final check:
The solutions are integer pairs $(x, y)$ in the square $[-100, 100] \times [-100, 100]$.
The equation $12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = 0$ corresponds to two lines through the origin: $y = \frac{4}{3}x$ and $y = -\frac{3}{2}x$.
We are counting integer points on these lines within the specified square.
Line 1: $y = \frac{4}{3}x$. Points are $(3k, 4k)$. $-100 \le 3k \le 100$ and $-100 \le 4k \le 100$. $k \in [-33, 33]$ and $k \in [-25, 25]$. Combined: $k \in [-25, 25]$. Number of points: $25 - (-25) + 1 = 51$.
Line 2: $y = -\frac{3}{2}x$. Points are $(x, -\frac{3}{2}x)$. For $y$ to be an integer, $x$ must be even. Let $x = 2k'$. Then $y = -\frac{3}{2}(2k') = -3k'$. Points are $(2k', -3k')$.
$-100 \le 2k' \le 100 \implies k' \in [-50, 50]$.
$-100 \le -3k' \le 100 \implies \frac{100}{-3} \le k' \le \frac{-100}{-3} \implies -33.33 \le k' \le 33.33$. Combined: $k' \in [-33, 33]$. Number of points: $33 - (-33) + 1 = 67$.
The only common point is $(0, 0)$ (when $k=0$ for line 1, and $k'=0$ for line 2).
Total number of distinct points = $51 + 67 - 1 = 117$.

The alternative parameterization for line 2: $x=-2k, y=3k$.
$-100 \le -2k \le 100 \implies k \in [-50, 50]$.
$-100 \le 3k \le 100 \implies k \in [-33, 33]$.
Combined: $k \in [-33, 33]$. Number of points: $33 - (-33) + 1 = 67$.
This is consistent.

Final result seems correct.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{117}$
