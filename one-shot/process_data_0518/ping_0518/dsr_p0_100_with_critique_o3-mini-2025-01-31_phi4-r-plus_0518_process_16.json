            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Let's denote the constant of proportionality as k. The formula: P = k * A * V^3. Given that when V=8, A=2, then P=4. So we get: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now, for the second scenario, we have A=4, P=32, and unknown V. So: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Now find cube root: V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11 because 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 equals 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) = (cube root of 4). But maybe it's better to express as cube root of 2048. Alternatively, note that 2048 = 8^3? Actually 8^3 = 512, no. Let's try: 16^3=4096, 12^3=1728, so not an integer. Let's check: maybe 2048 is not a perfect cube. Alternatively, we can simplify: V^3 = 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). That is the exact answer. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: 2^(2/3) approximately equals 1.5874, so V approx equals 8*1.5874= 12.6992 mph. But the answer is probably expected as cube root of 2048 or as 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). There's no simpler rational number. Alternatively, we can also write it as 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, we have: 32 = (1/64) V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify: 2048/512=4, but not sure.\n\nLet's check: 2^11=2048, cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). That is the answer.\n\nWe can also rationalize: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI think I'll say: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or 8*2^(2/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer with final answer in a box. I'll produce answer in a box: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}. I'll produce answer with step-by-step explanation. We'll produce answer with step-by-step explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer with final answer in a box. I'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer with step-by-step explanation. We'll produce answer with explanation: The pressure P = k A V^3. Given P=4 when V=8 and A=2, so 4 = k (2)(8^3)= k (2)(512)= 1024k, so k=4/1024=1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, solve 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3)=8*2^(2/3). That is the answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use k to find the unknown wind velocity when P = 32 pounds and A = 4 ft\u00b2:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThis is the exact value of the wind velocity. If you prefer a decimal approximation:\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, so\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given that pressure P varies jointly as area A and cube of wind's velocity V. That means: P = k A V^3. We are given: when V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4 lb. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). But 8^3 = 512. So equation: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So use equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Now we need cube root of 2048. Let's factor: 2048 = 2^11. Wait: 2^11 = 2048. Then cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is not a nice number. Let's check: Possibly we made error. Let's check: Actually, 32 = 1/64 * V^3 implies V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. But maybe we need to find V in miles per hour? But it's not a perfect cube. Let's check: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so V is between 12 and 13 mph. But perhaps the answer is expressed in radical form: V = cube root of 2048 = 8 * cube root of 2^(2/3)? Let me re-check: Actually, 2048 = 2^11. Then cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But that's not a nice number. Alternatively, we can express answer as: V = cube root of (32*64) = cube root of 2048 = 16 * cube root of 8? Wait, let me check: 2048/64 = 32, not sure.\n\nLet's check: 32 = (1/64)*V^3 implies V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. The cube root of 2048 is not a nice integer. But maybe I made a mistake: The problem says \"jointly as the area and the cube of the wind's velocity.\" That means P = k * A * V^3. Our computed constant k = 1/256. Then if A=4, P=32, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, which simplifies to 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, then V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. 2048 is 2^11. So V = 2^(11/3) mph = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3) mph. But perhaps they want a decimal approximation? 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4? Actually, 2^(2/3) = (2^(1/3))^2, and 2^(1/3) is about 1.2599, so squared is about 1.5874. Then V is about 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approximately. But let me re-check: Actually, 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph. So answer: V \u2248 12.70 mph. But wait, maybe we check: if V=12.70 mph, then V^3 = 12.70^3 = 12.70*12.70*12.70, which is about 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 12.7*12.7=161.29, times 12.7 = 2048.383, which is close.\n\nI want to re-check the constant: P = k * A * V^3. With given: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = 1024k, so k=4/1024 = 1/256. So then for second scenario: P=32, A=4, so 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). That is the exact answer.\n\nMaybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the exact answer. Alternatively, approximate to 12.70 mph.\n\nLet's check: Actually, 8 * cube root of 4 mph = 8* (cube root of 4) mph. Cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph. So answer: approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any possibility that I misinterpreted \"varies jointly\" as \"P = k A V^3\". Yes, that's correct.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a boxed answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. But wait, let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph is the same as 2^(3+2/3)=2^(11/3) mph. But it's best to express as 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as cube root of 2048 mph. But 8* cube root of 4 mph is simpler.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. Alternatively, \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer.

So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But then we can also compute approximate value: cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. But maybe we can express answer as 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, simplify: 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, maybe we can express as 8 * cube root of 4. Wait, let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3)=2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But likely the answer is expressed as \"cube root of 2048\" mph, or \"8 * cube root of 4 mph.\" Alternatively, we can simplify further: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). Let me check if it's a neat number: Actually, 2^(11/3) is not a nice integer because 2^3=8, 2^(4)=16, so it's in between 8 and 16. Let's compute: cube root of 2048 approximates: 12.7 mph. But I think it's acceptable to leave answer in radical form.\n\nLet's see: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, then V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). We can also write as 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. I'll check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph approximates 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.

Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply (1/256) by 4:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 because 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048. Therefore:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express this as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(9/3) \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}\n\nThis is the exact answer; if you approximate it, you get approximately 12.7 mph.",

Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, P=4 pounds. So find k: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find wind velocity when A=4, P=32. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3. 32 * 64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^? Let's check: 2^11=2048, since 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V = cube root (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8 * cube root(4). But maybe the answer expects numerical value?

But cube root of 256 is not integer either. Alternatively, we can say V = 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we want a decimal approximation: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) approx?

Wait, let's re-check: 2048 = 2^11, cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V=8*2^(2/3). But check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, so answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4). But we can also simplify: 8*(cube root of 4) mph. But 8*(cube root of 4) mph is not simpler than 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can leave answer as cube root of 2048 mph.\n\nLet's check: 8*(cube root of 4) mph. But wait, 8*(cube root of 4) is exactly 8*(cube root of 4) mph.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So mathematically: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4, so we have 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so equation becomes 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find wind velocity when pressure on sail area 4 is 32 pounds. So 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root equals 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8* cube root of 4, but maybe a simpler expression: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But we can also compute approximate value: cube root of 2048 is cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = cube root of 8 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of 256 = 2 * (cube root of 256). But 256 = 2^8, so cube root equals 2^(8/3) = 2^(2+2/3) = 4 * cube root of 4, so not simpler. Alternatively, note that 2048 = 8^3? Wait, check: 8^3 = 512, not 2048. Let's recalc: 8^3 = 512, 16^3 = 4096, so no. So answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph. But cube root of 2048 equals 12.7 approx?

So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nBut wait, check: earlier, 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so k = 4/(1024) = 1/256, then second equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, or approx 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, check: Actually, 2^(11/3) mph is the exact expression.\n\nWe can also simplify: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, express as 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Because 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, and 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4 mph. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll provide answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when:\n\u2003\u2003P = 32 pounds and A = 4 ft\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nFor a numerical approximation:\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) \u2248 1.5874, so\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}\u2003\u2003(or approximately 12.70 mph).",

Key Concepts and Correct Approach:\n\u2003\u2022 Recognize that pressure P varies jointly as area A and the cube of velocity V, meaning P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3 for some constant k.\n\u2003\u2022 Use given conditions to solve for k.\n\u2003\u2022 Substitute k into the second condition to solve for V by isolating V\u00b3 and then taking the cube root.\n\n2. Step-by-Step Verification of the Student\u2019s Solution:\n\u2003a. The student sets up the variation correctly: P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3.\n\u2003b. Substituting the first set of values (P = 4, A = 2, V = 8 mph):\n\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k\u00b72\u00b78\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, this becomes 4 = k\u00b71024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. (Correct)\n\u2003c. For the second part, the student substitutes P = 32 and A = 4:\n\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256)\u00b74\u00b7V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Simplify: 4/256 = 1/64 so the equation becomes 32 = (1/64)\u00b7V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Multiplying both sides by 64 yields V\u00b3 = 32\u00b764 = 2048. (Correct)\n\u2003d. The student then finds V = \u221b2048. They note that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so V = 2^(11/3), and also write it as 8\u00b7\u221b4. (Correct)\n\u2003e. The student provides an approximate value (\u2248 12.7 mph) which is consistent with the exact answer.\n\n3. Final Correct Answer:\n\u2003The wind velocity is\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}\u2003or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nConclusion: right [END]",
