Key Concepts and Correct Approach:\n\u2003\u2022 The pressure P varies jointly with the sail area A and the cube of the wind velocity V, hence the equation is: P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2022 First, use the given values (P = 4 pounds, A = 2 ft\u00b2, V = 8 mph) to find the constant k.\n\u2003\u2022 Then, substitute the new values (P = 32 pounds, A = 4 ft\u00b2) to solve for V.\n\n2. Step-by-Step Check of the Student\u2019s Solution:\n\u2003\u2022 The student correctly set up the relationship: P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2022 Substitution with P = 4, A = 2, and V = 8 gives:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. (This step is correct.)\n\u2003\u2022 Next, with P = 32 and A = 4, the student formed:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplifying: 32 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2022 Multiplying both sides by 64 yields:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048. (So far, so good.)\n\u2003\u2022 The student then stated that 2048 = 8\u00b3 and concluded V = 8. This is incorrect:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In fact, 8\u00b3 = 512, not 2048.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The correct step is to recognize that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so V\u00b3 = 2\u00b9\u00b9.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Taking the cube root gives: V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u202f\u221b(4).\n\n3. Correct Solution:\n\u2003Starting with V\u00b3 = 2048,\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2048) = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3) = 8\u00b7\u221b(4).\n\u2003Thus, the wind velocity is\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\u2003miles per hour.\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",

Up to here, everything is fine.\n4. The error arises when solving for V. The student claims that \"2048 = 8\u00b3\", but in fact 8\u00b3 = 512. The number 2048 is 2\u00b9\u00b9. Its cube root is V = \u221b(2048) = 2^(11/3) which can be rewritten as 2^(9/3+2/3) = 2^3\u00b72^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221a[3]{4}.\n\u2003\u2003Numerically, this is approximately 12.70 miles per hour, not 8 mph.\n\nStep 3.
