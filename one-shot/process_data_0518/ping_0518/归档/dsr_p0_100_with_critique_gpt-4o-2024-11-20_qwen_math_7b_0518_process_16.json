            "solution": "To solve the problem, we start by expressing the relationship between the pressure \\( P \\), the area \\( A \\), and the wind's velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity \\( V \\) is 8 miles per hour, the pressure \\( P \\) on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can substitute these values into the equation to find \\( k \\):\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity \\( V \\) when the pressure \\( P \\) on a sail of 4 square feet is 32 pounds.
