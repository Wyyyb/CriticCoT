Key Concepts and Correct Approach\n\u2022 Since pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V, the relationship is written as \n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3,\n\u2003where k is the proportionality constant.\n\u2022 Use the given conditions to first compute k and then plug in the new values of P and A to solve for V.\n\nStep 2. Checking Each Step of the Student\u2019s Solution\n\u2022 The student correctly set up the joint variation: P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Substituting the first set of data (P = 4, A = 2, V = 8) gives:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.\n\u2003The student computed 8\u00b3 = 512, so:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024.\n\u2003Then k = 4/1024 = 1/256. (This step is correct.)\n\u2022 Next, substituting for the second scenario (P = 32, A = 4) the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003The student correctly simplified (1/256) \u00b7 4 to 1/64, leading to:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Multiplying both sides by 64 gives:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048.\n\u2003Up to here, the work is correct.\n\u2022 However, the error occurs when the student evaluates the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u00b3\u221a2048.\n\u2003The student erroneously states that 2048 = 8\u00b3, hence concluding V = 8.\n\u2003In fact, 8\u00b3 = 512, not 2048. Note that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\u2003Thus, the correct cube root is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 \u00b3\u221a(4).\n\nStep 3. Corrected Final Solution\nStarting from:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048,\nwe write 2048 in terms of powers of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9.\nTaking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\nThus, the wind velocity is \n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\u2003\u2003(miles per hour).\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",

        "critique": "Step 1. Key Concepts and Correct Approach:\n\u2022 Recognize that the pressure varies jointly as the area and the cube of the velocity, so the relationship can be written as P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3, where k is the constant of proportionality.\n\u2022 Use the first scenario (P = 4, A = 2, V = 8) to determine k.\n\u2022 Substitute the found k into the equation for the second scenario (P = 32, A = 4) and solve for V.\n\nStep 2. Check Each Step of the Student\u2019s Solution:\n1. The student correctly sets up the relationship P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3.\n2. Substituting from the first scenario:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3\u2003\u2003 and since 8\u00b3 = 512, the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024.\n\u2003\u2003The student then correctly finds k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n3. For the second scenario, the student substitutes P = 32 and A = 4:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplifying gives 32 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiplying both sides by 64, the student gets V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048.\n4. The error occurs in the last step where the student takes the cube root of 2048 and claims that V = 12. In fact, 12\u00b3 = 1728 while 13\u00b3 = 2197, so 2048 is not a perfect cube, and the cube root of 2048 is best left in exact form.\n\nStep 3. Correct Solution:\n\u2022 We have V\u00b3 = 2048.\n\u2022 Express 2048 as a power of 2: Since 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, then\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2\u00b9\u00b9.\n\u2022 Taking the cube root, we get:\n\u2003\u2003V = (2\u00b9\u00b9)^(1/3) = 2^(11/3).\n\u2022 Writing 2^(11/3) as 2^(3 + 2/3) gives:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 \u221b(2\u00b2) = 8 \u221b(4).\n\nThus, the correct wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
