The relationship is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo find \\( k \\), we divide both sides by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\) and \\( A = 4 \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{4}{256} \\cdot V^3 = \\frac{1}{64} \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nWe can simplify \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nSo we have:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]",

Key Concepts and Correct Approach:  \n   The problem states that pressure P varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V:  \n   P = k A V\u00b3  \n   We use the given conditions to determine the constant k, and then solve for V under the new conditions.\n\n2. Checking Each Step:  \n   \u2022 The student correctly set up the relationship: P = k A V\u00b3.  \n   \u2022 Substituting P = 4, A = 2, V = 8 gives 4 = k \u00d7 2 \u00d7 8\u00b3 = k \u00d7 2 \u00d7 512, leading to k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.  \n   \u2022 They then substitute P = 32, A = 4 into P = k A V\u00b3 to get 32 = (1/256) \u00d7 4 \u00d7 V\u00b3 = (4/256) V\u00b3 = (1/64) V\u00b3.  \n     From there: V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048.  \n   \u2022 The student then concludes V = 12. However, 12\u00b3 = 1728 (not 2048). Hence, that step is incorrect.\n\n3. Correct Solution:  \n   Since 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, we have  \n   V\u00b3 = 2\u00b9\u00b9 \u21d2 V = 2^(11/3).  \n   Numerically, 2^(11/3) \u2248 12.699208... (about 12.7).  \n\n   Therefore, the correct wind velocity is  \n   \\(\\boxed{2^{\\tfrac{11}{3}} \\approx 12.7 \\text{ miles per hour}}\\).\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
