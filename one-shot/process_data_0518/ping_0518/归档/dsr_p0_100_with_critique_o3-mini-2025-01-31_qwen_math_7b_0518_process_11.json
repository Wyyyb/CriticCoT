Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 and 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use the equation \\( P = \\frac{1}{256} A V^3 \\) to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\) and \\( A = 4 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} \\]\n\nSince \\( 2048 = 8^3 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ V = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{8}\\) miles per hour.",

        "critique": "Step 1. Key concepts and correct approach:\n\u2022 Recognize that the problem involves joint variation so that P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Use the given initial condition (P = 4, A = 2, V = 8) to determine k.\n\u2022 Apply the k obtained to form the equation for the second case (P = 32, A = 4) and solve for V.\n\nStep 2. Checking the student's solution:\n\u2022 The student correctly wrote P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3.\n\u2022 They substituted the initial values: 4 = k\u00b72\u00b78\u00b3. Since 8\u00b3 = 512, the equation became 4 = k\u00b71024, yielding k = 4/1024 = 1/256. This step is correct.\n\u2022 Plugging into the second scenario: 32 = (1/256)\u00b74\u00b7V\u00b3. The product (1/256\u00b74) simplifies to 1/64, so the equation becomes 32 = V\u00b3/64, leading to V\u00b3 = 32\u00b764 = 2048. So far, so good.\n\u2022 The error occurs when the student concludes that 2048 = 8\u00b3 and thus V = 8. In reality, 8\u00b3 = 512, not 2048.\n\nStep 3. The correct solution:\n\u2022 We have V\u00b3 = 2048. Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9.\n\u2022 Taking the cube root gives V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\u2022 Alternatively, recognize that 2^(2/3) = \u221b(4), so we can also express the answer as V = 8\u00b7\u221b(4).\n\nThus, the correct wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}}}\u2003(miles per hour).\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
