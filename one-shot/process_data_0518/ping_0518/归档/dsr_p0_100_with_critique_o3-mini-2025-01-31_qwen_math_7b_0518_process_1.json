The pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the velocity V, so we write P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3, where k is a constant.\n\u2022 Use the first set of data (P = 4 pounds, A = 2 ft\u00b2, V = 8 mph) to solve for k.\n\u2022 Then substitute the constant k, along with the second set of data (P = 32 pounds, A = 4 ft\u00b2) to find V.\n\nStep 2. Analysis of the Student's Solution:\n\u2022 The student correctly formulates the equation P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Substituting the given values 4 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3) and computing 8\u00b3 = 512, the student obtains 4 = 1024k and correctly finds k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\u2022 Next, the student substitutes P = 32, A = 4, and k = 1/256 into the equation.

The student concludes that \u221b2048 = 12, but actually 12\u00b3 = 1728 and 13\u00b3 = 2197. In fact, 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so \u221b2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8\u00b72^(2/3), which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nStep 3. Correct Solution:\n1.

Checking the Student's Steps  \n1. The student correctly set up the equation: P = k A V\u00b3.  \n2. Substitution of P = 4, A = 2, V = 8 gives:  \n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.  \n3. They computed 8\u00b3 = 512, so the equation becomes:  \n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024,  \nand correctly solved for k = 4/1024 = 1/256.  \n4.

Then use that value of k with the new conditions and solve for V.\n\nStep 2. Checking the Student\u2019s Solution\n\u2022 The student correctly sets up the model: \n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Using the first set of values (P = 4 pounds, A = 2 ft\u00b2, V = 8 mph):\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.\n\u2003\u20038\u00b3 is computed as 512, so:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024.\n\u2003\u2003Dividing both sides by 1024, the student finds k = 4/1024 = 1/256. This is correct.\n\u2022 Next, the student uses the second set of conditions (P = 32 pounds, A = 4 ft\u00b2) and substitutes into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplifying, (1/256)*4 = 1/64, so the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiplying both sides by 64 gives:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64.\n\u2003\u2003Computing 32 \u00b7 64, the student correctly finds 2048.\n\u2022 To solve for V, the student takes the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048.\n\u2022 Here lies the error: The student claims \u201cWe know that 2048 = 8\u00b3,\u201d which is incorrect because 8\u00b3 = 512. In fact, 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9. Therefore,\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u221b4.\nThus, the final answer should be V = 8\u221b4 mph (approximately 12.70 mph), not 8 mph.\n\nStep 3. Correct Solution and Final Answer\nThe correct process gives:\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\nwith k = 1/256.\nUsing P = 32 pounds and A = 4 ft\u00b2:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3,\nso,\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048.\nTake the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 8 \u221b4.\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}.\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
