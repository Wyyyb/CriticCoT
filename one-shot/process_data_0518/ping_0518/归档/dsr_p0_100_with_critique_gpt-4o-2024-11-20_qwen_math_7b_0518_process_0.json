They incorrectly state that \\( 8 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 8 \\cdot 2 = 4 \\), which is mathematically incorrect. The correct simplification is:\n\\[\nV = 8 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{4}\n\\]\nThe student does not correctly compute \\( \\sqrt[3]{4} \\), and their final answer of \\( \\boxed{8} \\) is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Correct solution\nFrom the previous steps, we know:\n\\[\nV^3 = 2048\n\\]\nTaking the cube root:\n\\[\nV = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = \\sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^3 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 8 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{4}\n\\]\nThus, the exact value of \\( V \\) is:\n\\[\nV = 8 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{4}\n\\]\nApproximating \\( \\sqrt[3]{4} \\) numerically (using a calculator):\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{4} \\approx 1.587\n\\]\nSo:\n\\[\nV \\approx 8 \\cdot 1.587 = 12.696\n\\]\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[\nV \\approx 12.70\n\\]\nThe correct wind velocity is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12.70 \\, \\text{miles per hour}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe student's solution is **wrong** because they made an error in simplifying \\( 2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\) and incorrectly concluded that \\( V = 8 \\). The correct wind velocity is approximately \\( \\boxed{12.70} \\). [END]",
