            "solution": "To solve the problem, we start by expressing the relationship between the pressure \\( P \\), the area \\( A \\), and the wind's velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo find \\( k \\), we divide both sides by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use the equation \\( P = \\frac{1}{256} A V^3 \\) to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\) and \\( A = 4 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{4}{256} V^3 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nWe can simplify \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.",

        "critique": "Step 1. Key Concepts and Approach:\n\u2022 The problem involves joint variation. The pressure P varies jointly as area A and the cube of the velocity V, so we write:\n\u2003\u2003P = k A V\u00b3,\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\u2022 First, determine k using the given condition: When A = 2 ft\u00b2, V = 8 mph, and P = 4 lbs.\n\u2022 Then, use the formula with the new conditions (A = 4 ft\u00b2, P = 32 lbs) to solve for V.\n\nStep 2. Checking the Student\u2019s Solution:\n1. The student correctly wrote the joint variation equation:\n\u2003\u2003P = k A V\u00b3.\n2. Substitution for the first condition:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3),\n\u2003\u20038\u00b3 = 512, so the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024.\n\u2003\u2003Solving gives k = 4/1024 = 1/256. (This is correct.)\n3. For the new condition (A = 4, P = 32):\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplifying: (1/256)*4 = 1/64, so:\n\u2003\u200332 = V\u00b3/64\u2003\u27f9\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64.\n\u2003\u200332 \u00b7 64 = 2048, so V\u00b3 = 2048.\n4. The error occurs in computing the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003The student wrote V = \u221b2048 = 12.\n\u2003\u2003However, note that 12\u00b3 = 1728, not 2048.\n\u2003\u2003In fact, 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, and so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8\u00b72^(2/3) = 8\u00b7\u221b4.\n\u2003\u2003Numerically, 8\u00b7\u221b4 \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.699 mph.\n\u2003\u2003Thus, the correct value of V is not exactly 12 mph.\n\nStep 3. Correct Solution and Final Answer:\n\u2022 We have determined V\u00b3 = 2048, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u00b7\u221b4\u2003or equivalently\u2003V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\u2022 Therefore, the correct wind velocity is \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} miles per hour.\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
