Analysis of Each Step in the Student\u2019s Solution:\n1. The student correctly writes the relationship as P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3.\n2.

            "solution": "To solve the problem, we start by expressing the relationship between the pressure \\( P \\), the area \\( A \\), and the wind's velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo find \\( k \\), we divide both sides by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{4}{256} \\cdot V^3 = \\frac{1}{64} \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nWe can simplify \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) miles per hour.",

        "critique": "Step 1: Key Concepts and Correct Approach\n\u2022 The pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V, so the relation is P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2022 We use the given condition (P = 4 when A = 2 and V = 8) to determine the constant k.\n\u2022 Then we substitute the second condition (P = 32 and A = 4) into the formula to solve for V.\n\nStep 2: Checking Each Step in the Student's Solution\n1. The student correctly set up the equation as P = kAV\u00b3.\n2. Substituting P = 4, A = 2, and V = 8, the student wrote:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, this became 4 = k \u00b7 1024.\n3. Dividing both sides by 1024, the student found k = 4/1024 = 1/256. This part is correct.\n4. For the second condition, the student substituted P = 32, A = 4, and k = 1/256 into the formula:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplifying gives 32 = (4/256) V\u00b3 = (1/64) V\u00b3.\n5. Multiplying both sides by 64, the student obtained V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048. This is also correct.\n6. The student then took the cube root of both sides and stated:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048 = 16.\n\u2003\u2003Here is the error. In fact, 16\u00b3 = 4096, not 2048.\n\nStep 3: Correcting the Error and Providing the Correct Solution\nWe have V\u00b3 = 2048. Notice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 because 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048. Taking the cube root, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3).\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221b(2\u00b2) = 8\u221b4.\nThus, the correct wind velocity is V = 8\u221b4 miles per hour.\n\nFinal Answer:\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
