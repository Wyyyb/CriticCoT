We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo find \\( k \\), we divide both sides by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use the equation \\( P = \\frac{1}{256} A V^3 \\) to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\) and \\( A = 4 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{4}{256} V^3 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nWe can simplify \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.",

        "critique": "1. Key Concepts and Correct Approach  \n   The problem states that the pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the sail\u2019s area A and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V. This corresponds to the equation P = k A V\u00b3 for some constant k.\n\n2. Checking the Student\u2019s Steps  \n   \u2022 They correctly set up P = k A V\u00b3.  \n   \u2022 They used the data (P = 4 lbs, A = 2 ft\u00b2, V = 8 mph) to solve for k:  \n     4 = k\u00b72\u00b7(8\u00b3) \u21d2 4 = 2\u00b7512\u00b7k \u21d2 4 = 1024k \u21d2 k = 4/1024 = 1/256.  \n     That part is correct.  \n   \u2022 Substituting k = 1/256 and the new conditions (P = 32, A = 4) gives:  \n     32 = (1/256)\u00b74\u00b7V\u00b3 \u21d2 32 = (4/256) V\u00b3 \u21d2 32 = (1/64) V\u00b3.  \n   \u2022 Solving for V\u00b3:  \n     V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048.  \n     Hence V = \u00b3\u221a2048 = \u00b2^(11/3).  \n     Numerically, this is approximately 12.70\u2026 mph (not exactly 12).\n\n   The student\u2019s calculation for V\u00b3 = 2048 is correct, but their conclusion that the cube root of 2048 equals 12 is incorrect. The exact value is 2^(11/3), which is approximately 12.7.\n\n3. Correct Solution  \n   From V\u00b3 = 2048,  \n   V = \u00b3\u221a2048 = 2^(11/3) \u2248 12.7 miles per hour.  \n\n\\(\\boxed{V \\approx 12.7 \\text{ miles per hour}}\\)\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
