We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 and 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use the equation \\( P = \\frac{1}{256} A V^3 \\) to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\) and \\( A = 4 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} \\]\n\nSince \\( 2048 = 8^3 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ V = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{8}\\) miles per hour.",

        "critique": "1) Key Concepts and Correct Approach:  \n\u2022 The pressure P varies jointly as area A and the cube of velocity V, so P = k A V\u00b3.  \n\u2022 Solve for the constant k using the known values (P, A, V).  \n\u2022 Substitute the new values of P and A into the same equation to solve for V.  \n\n2) Step-by-Step Check:  \n\u2022 The student correctly set up P = k A V\u00b3.  \n\u2022 With P = 4, A = 2, V = 8, it follows 4 = k \u00d7 2 \u00d7 8\u00b3.  \n\u2022 8\u00b3 = 512, so 4 = k \u00d7 2 \u00d7 512 = 1024k, giving k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. (Correct.)  \n\u2022 Then, for P = 32, A = 4, we have 32 = (1/256) \u00d7 4 \u00d7 V\u00b3 = (4/256) V\u00b3 = (1/64) V\u00b3.  \n\u2022 Hence V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048. (Correct.)  \n\u2022 The error: The student incorrectly stated 2048 = 8\u00b3. In fact, 8\u00b3 = 512. Correctly, V = \u221b(2048) = 2^(11/3) \u2248 12.7.  \n\n3) Errors and Correct Solution:  \n\u2022 The student\u2019s final step, equating 2048 to 8\u00b3, is wrong.  \n\u2022 Correctly, V\u00b3 = 2048 \u21d2 V = \u221b(2048) = 2^(11/3) \u2248 12.7 miles/hour.  \n\n\\(\\boxed{V \\approx 12.7 \\text{ miles per hour}}\\)\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
