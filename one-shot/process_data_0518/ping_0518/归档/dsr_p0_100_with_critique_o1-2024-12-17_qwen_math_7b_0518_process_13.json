        "critique": "1. Key Concepts and Correct Approach:  \n   \u2022 The pressure P varies jointly as the sail area A and the cube of the wind velocity V, so we set up P = k A V\u00b3.  \n   \u2022 Use the given data (P, A, V) to find the constant k.  \n   \u2022 Substitute the new P, A, and k back into P = k A V\u00b3 to solve for the new velocity V.  \n\n2. Checking the Student's Steps:  \n   \u2022 The equation setup, P = k A V\u00b3, is correct.  \n   \u2022 Substituting P = 4, A = 2, and V = 8 to find k:  \n     4 = k \u22c5 2 \u22c5 8\u00b3.  \n     8\u00b3 = 512, so 4 = 1024k \u21d2 k = 4/1024 = 1/256.  (Correct)  \n   \u2022 Using this k to find V when P = 32 and A = 4:  \n     32 = (1/256) \u22c5 4 \u22c5 V\u00b3 \u21d2 32 = (4/256) V\u00b3 = (1/64) V\u00b3.  \n     Multiply both sides by 64:  \n     V\u00b3 = 32 \u22c5 64 = 2048.  \n     Up to here, everything is correct.  \n   \u2022 Taking the cube root of 2048:  \n     2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3) \u2248 12.699.  \n     The student incorrectly stated V = 16. In fact, 16\u00b3 = 4096, not 2048.  \n\n3. Correct Solution:  \n   Therefore, the correct velocity is \u221b2048 = 2^(11/3) \u2248 12.699 miles per hour, not 16 miles per hour.  \n\n\\boxed{2^\\frac{11}{3} \\text{ (approximately }12.699\\text{ mph)}}  \n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
