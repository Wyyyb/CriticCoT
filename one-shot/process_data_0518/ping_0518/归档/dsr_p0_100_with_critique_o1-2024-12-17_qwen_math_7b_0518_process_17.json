We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can substitute these values into the equation to find \\( k \\):\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nSimplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. We substitute \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nSimplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{4}{256} \\cdot V^3 = \\frac{1}{64} \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nWe can simplify \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) miles per hour.",

        "critique": "1) Key Concepts and Correct Approach  \nThe relationship \u201cpressure varies jointly as the sail area and the cube of velocity\u201d translates to the equation  \nP = k A V\u00b3,  \nwhere k is a constant of proportionality. We use the given data (P, A, and V) to determine k, then use that k to find the unknown velocity for a new pressure and sail area.\n\n2) Checking the Student\u2019s Steps  \n\u2022 The student correctly sets up the joint variation equation: P = k A V\u00b3.  \n\u2022 Substituting P = 4, A = 2, V = 8 into the equation 4 = k\u00b72\u00b78\u00b3 is correct.  \n\u2022 Calculating 8\u00b3 = 512 and simplifying 4 = k\u00b72\u00b7512 = k\u00b71024, hence k = 1/256, is correct.  \n\u2022 Next, for P = 32 and A = 4, they correctly set up 32 = (1/256)\u00b74\u00b7V\u00b3 = (4/256)\u00b7V\u00b3 = (1/64)\u00b7V\u00b3.  \n\u2022 Solving 32 = (1/64)\u00b7V\u00b3 gives V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048.  \n\u2022 The error occurs in the last step: the student incorrectly claims the cube root of 2048 is 16. In fact, 16\u00b3 = 4096. The correct cube root is 2^(11/3), which is approximately 12.697..., i.e. about 12.7.\n\n3) Correct Solution  \nStarting with the correct steps, the only fix is to compute the correct cube root of 2048:\n\nV\u00b3 = 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9  \u21d2  V = 2^(11/3) \u2248 12.7.\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.  \n\n\\(\\boxed{V \\approx 12.7 \\text{ miles per hour}}\\)\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
