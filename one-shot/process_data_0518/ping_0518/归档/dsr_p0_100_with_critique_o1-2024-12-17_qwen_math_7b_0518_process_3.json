From any given set of values (P, A, V), one solves for the constant of proportionality k, then uses that same constant to find the missing variable in the new scenario.\n\n2. Checking the Student\u2019s Steps  \n\u2022 The student correctly sets up the equation P = k A V\u00b3.  \n\u2022 Substituting P = 4, A = 2, and V = 8 gives 4 = k \u00d7 2 \u00d7 8\u00b3.  \n\u2022 8\u00b3 = 512, so 4 = 1024k, hence k = 4/1024 = 1/256. This step is correct.  \n\u2022 Next, for P = 32 and A = 4, the student writes 32 = (1/256)(4)V\u00b3 \u2192 32 = (4/256)V\u00b3 = (1/64)V\u00b3, also correct so far.  \n\u2022 Multiplying both sides by 64 yields V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048, which is also correct.  \n\u2022 The student then concludes V = 12. However, 12\u00b3 = 1728, not 2048. The actual cube root of 2048 is 2^(11/3), approximately 12.7.  \n\nThis is the point where the student\u2019s answer is incorrect: the cube root of 2048 is not 12.\n\n3. Corrected Solution  \nAfter obtaining V\u00b3 = 2048, one should compute V = \u221b2048. Since 8\u00b3 = 512 and 12\u00b3 = 1728, 13\u00b3 = 2197, the exact expression is 2^(11/3), and numerically this is approximately 12.7.\n\nTherefore, the correct wind velocity when the pressure is 32 pounds on 4 square feet of sail is:  \n\\(\\boxed{V = 2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\approx 12.7 \\text{ miles per hour}}\\)\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
