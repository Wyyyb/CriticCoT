Substituting the given values \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3\n\\]\n\nThe student correctly calculates \\( 8^3 = 512 \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512\n\\]\n\nNext, the student multiplies \\( 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\), simplifying the equation to:\n\n\\[\n4 = k \\cdot 1024\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), the student divides both sides by 1024:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256}\n\\]\n\nThis step is correct, and the value of \\( k \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{256} \\).\n\n---\n\n#### Step 2.2: Finding \\( V \\) for the New Conditions\nThe student substitutes \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = k A V^3 \\):\n\n\\[\n32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3\n\\]\n\nFirst, the student calculates \\( \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3\n\\]\n\nNext, the student multiplies both sides by 64 to isolate \\( V^3 \\):\n\n\\[\nV^3 = 32 \\cdot 64\n\\]\n\nThe student correctly calculates \\( 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nV^3 = 2048\n\\]\n\nFinally, the student takes the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nV = \\sqrt[3]{2048}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 2048 = 8^3 \\), the student concludes:\n\n\\[\nV = 8\n\\]\n\nThis step is also correct.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\nThe student's final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8} \\, \\text{miles per hour.}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe student's solution is **correct**.
