Analyzing the Student's Work:\n\u2022 The student correctly sets up the equation as P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Substituting the first set (P = 4, A = 2, V = 8), the student writes 4 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3. The computation 8\u00b3 = 512 is correct.\n\u2022 Multiplying 2 by 512 gives 1024, so 4 = k \u00b7 1024 \u2192 k = 4/1024 = 1/256. This is correct.\n\u2022 Next, for the second condition (P = 32, A = 4), the student substitutes to obtain 32 = (1/256)\u00b74\u00b7V\u00b3. Multiplying (1/256)\u00b74 gives 1/64, i.e., 32 = (1/64)\u00b7V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Multiplying both sides by 64 gives V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048. This is correct.\n\u2022 The error occurs when the student takes the cube root. The student claims 2048 = 8\u00b3, but 8\u00b3 = 512, not 2048. In fact, 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9.\n\u2022 Therefore, V\u00b3 = 2048 implies V = \u00b2\u221b(2048) = 2^(11/3) = 8\u00b72^(2/3) = 8\u00b7\u221b4 (which is approximately 12.7).\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "To solve the problem, we start by expressing the relationship between the pressure \\( P \\), the area \\( A \\), and the wind's velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. The problem states that the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity. This can be written as:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 and 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo find \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\) and \\( A = 4 \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we multiply \\(\\frac{1}{256}\\) and 4:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = V^3 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nSo we have:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} \\]\n\nWe know that \\( 2048 = 8^3 \\), so:\n\n\\[ V = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",

Key concepts and correct approach:\n\u2022 Recognize that pressure varies jointly with area and the cube of wind velocity: P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Use the given condition (when V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 lbs) to solve for the constant k.\n\u2022 Substitute the new conditions (A = 4 ft\u00b2, P = 32 lbs) and solve for V.\n\nStep 2. Checking the student\u2019s solution:\n\u2022 The student correctly writes: P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Substitution of the initial values gives 4 = k\u00b72\u00b78\u00b3. Since 8\u00b3 = 512, then 2\u00b7512 = 1024. From this, they obtain k = 4/1024 = 1/256. (This step is correct.)\n\u2022 For the second part, they substitute P = 32 and A = 4 into the equation, leading to 32 = (1/256)\u00b74\u00b7V\u00b3, and then simplify to 32 = (1/64)\u00b7V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Multiplying both sides by 64 gives V\u00b3 = 32\u00b764 = 2048.\n\u2022 The error occurs when finding the cube root. The student claims that 2048 = 8\u00b3. However, 8\u00b3 = 512, not 2048.\n\nStep 3. Correct solution:\n\u2022 We have V\u00b3 = 2048. Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2048) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8\u00b72^(2/3) = 8\u00b7\u221b(4).\nThus, the correct wind velocity is \n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}.\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
