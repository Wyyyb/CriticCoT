            "solution": "To solve the problem, we start by expressing the relationship between the pressure \\( P \\), the area \\( A \\), and the wind's velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo find \\( k \\), we divide both sides by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{4}{256} \\cdot V^3 = \\frac{1}{64} \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nWe can simplify \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) miles per hour.",

        "critique": "Let's analyze the student's solution step by step to determine if it is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Key Mathematical Concepts and Correct Approach\nThe problem states that the pressure \\( P \\) varies jointly as the area \\( A \\) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \\( V \\). This relationship can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nP = k A V^3\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is the constant of proportionality. The solution involves:\n1. Using the given values to determine \\( k \\).\n2. Substituting the new values of \\( P \\) and \\( A \\) to solve for \\( V \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Checking Each Step of the Student's Solution\n\n#### Step 2.1: Finding \\( k \\)\nThe student correctly substitutes the given values \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation \\( P = k A V^3 \\):\n\n\\[\n4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3\n\\]\n\nThe student calculates \\( 8^3 = 512 \\), which is correct. Substituting this, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n4 = k \\cdot 1024\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), the student divides both sides by 1024:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256}\n\\]\n\nThis calculation is correct, and the value of \\( k \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{256} \\).\n\n---\n\n#### Step 2.2: Finding \\( V \\) for the New Conditions\nThe student substitutes \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = k A V^3 \\):\n\n\\[\n32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n32 = \\frac{4}{256} \\cdot V^3 = \\frac{1}{64} \\cdot V^3\n\\]\n\nThis step is correct. To solve for \\( V^3 \\), the student multiplies both sides by 64:\n\n\\[\nV^3 = 32 \\cdot 64\n\\]\n\nThe student calculates \\( 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\), which is correct. Thus:\n\n\\[\nV^3 = 2048\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), the student takes the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nV = \\sqrt[3]{2048}\n\\]\n\nThe student correctly calculates \\( \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 16 \\). Therefore, the wind velocity is:\n\n\\[\nV = 16\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nThe student's solution is correct. The wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{16} \\, \\text{miles per hour.}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion: right [END]**",
