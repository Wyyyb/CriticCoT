We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} \\]\n\nSince \\( 2048 = 8^3 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ V = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{8}\\) miles per hour.",

        "critique": "1. Key Concepts and Correct Approach:  \n   \u2022 The problem states that P (pressure) varies jointly as A (area) and V\u00b3 (the cube of velocity), so P = k A V\u00b3.  \n   \u2022 Find the constant k using the first scenario (P = 4, A = 2, V = 8), then use that k to solve for the unknown velocity in the second scenario (P = 32, A = 4).\n\n2. Checking Each Step of the Student\u2019s Solution:  \n   \u2022 The student correctly used P = k A V\u00b3 and substituted P = 4, A = 2, and V = 8 to find k.  \n       4 = k \u22c5 2 \u22c5 8\u00b3 \u2192 8\u00b3 = 512 \u2192 4 = k \u22c5 2 \u22c5 512 \u2192 4 = 1024k \u2192 k = 1/256.  \n   \u2022 Next, they correctly set up 32 = (1/256) \u22c5 4 \u22c5 V\u00b3 to solve for V. That simplifies to 32 = (4/256) V\u00b3 = (1/64) V\u00b3 \u2192 V\u00b3 = 2048.  \n   \u2022 The error is in concluding that the cube root of 2048 is 8. Since 8\u00b3 = 512, not 2048, this step is incorrect. The correct value of V is \u221b2048, which is about 12.7.\n\n3. Correct Solution:  \n   From V\u00b3 = 2048,  \n   V = \u221b2048 = 2^(11/3) \u2248 12.7 miles per hour.  \n\n\\(\\boxed{12.7 \\text{ miles per hour (approximately)}}\\)\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
