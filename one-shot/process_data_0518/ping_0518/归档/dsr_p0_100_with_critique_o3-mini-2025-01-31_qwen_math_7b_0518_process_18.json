Checking Each Step of the Student\u2019s Solution:\n\u2022 The student sets up the equation correctly: P = kAV\u00b3.\n\u2022 They substitute P = 4, A = 2, V = 8 into the equation:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.\n\u2022 The calculation 8\u00b3 = 512 is correct, leading to:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024, so that k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\u2022 Next, the student substitutes P = 32, A = 4, and k = 1/256 into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3,\nwhich simplifies to:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) V\u00b3 = (1/64) V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Multiplying both sides by 64 gives V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64.\n\u2003\u2003They compute 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048, which is correct.\n\u2022 Then they take the cube root of both sides: V = \u221b2048.\n\u2022 The error occurs in their next statement: they claim \u201cwe know that 2048 = 8\u00b3\u201d.

Since 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, we have V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3). This is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\nStep 3. Correct Solution:\n1. We begin with:\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n2. Using P = 4, A = 2, V = 8:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3) = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = 1024k\u2003\u27f9\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n3. Using k, A = 4, and P = 32:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\u2003\u27f9\u200332 = V\u00b3/64.\n4. Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048.\n5. Write 2048 as a power of 2: 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9. Then:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n6. Therefore, the correct wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\u2003or\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\u2003\\boxed{8\\cdot2^{2/3}}.\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",

            "solution": "To solve the problem, we start by expressing the relationship between the pressure \\( P \\), the area \\( A \\), and the wind's velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\).

Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} \\]\n\nSince \\( 2048 = 8^3 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ V = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{8}\\) miles per hour.",

Checking the Student\u2019s Steps:\n\u2022 The student writes P = kAV\u00b3, which is correct.\n\u2022 Substituting P = 4, A = 2, and V = 8, the student gets:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.\n\u2022 They compute 8\u00b3 = 512 and then multiply by 2 to obtain 1024, so the equation is 4 = 1024k.\n\u2022 Dividing by 1024 correctly gives k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\u2022 Next, with P = 32, A = 4, and k = 1/256:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2022 The student simplifies (1/256) \u00b7 4 to 1/64, obtaining:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Multiplying both sides by 64, they find:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048.\n\u2022 The error occurs in finding the cube root of 2048.

Correcting the Error:\nTo solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048.\nRecognize that 2048 = 512 \u00d7 4 and since the cube root of 512 is 8, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(512 \u00d7 4) = \u221b512 \u00d7 \u221b4 = 8 \u2219 \u221b4.\nThus, the correct wind velocity is V = 8\u221b4 miles per hour.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
