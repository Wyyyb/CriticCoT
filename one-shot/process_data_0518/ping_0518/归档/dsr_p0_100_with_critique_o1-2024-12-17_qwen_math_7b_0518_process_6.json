        "critique": "1) Key Concepts and Correct Approach  \nThe problem states that the pressure P exerted by the wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V. Mathematically, this is expressed as P = k A V\u00b3, where k is the constant of proportionality. The correct method is:  \n\u2022 Use the given P, A, and V to solve for k.  \n\u2022 Substitute the new values of P and A (and the found k) to determine the new V.  \n\n2) Checking the Student\u2019s Steps  \n\u2022 The student sets up the formula correctly as P = k A V\u00b3.  \n\u2022 Substituting the values P=4, A=2, V=8 gives the equation 4 = k\u00b72\u00b7(8\u00b3).  \n\u2022 8\u00b3 = 512, so 4 = k\u00b71024, hence k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Up to this point, everything is correct.  \n\u2022 Next, for the new conditions P=32 and A=4, the equation becomes 32 = (1/256)\u00b74\u00b7V\u00b3 \u21d2 32 = (1/64)\u00b7V\u00b3 \u21d2 32\u00b764 = V\u00b3 \u21d2 V\u00b3 = 2048.  \n\u2022 The student concludes that V = 8 because they treated 2048 as 8\u00b3.
