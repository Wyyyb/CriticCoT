We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 and 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo find \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\) and \\( A = 4 \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we multiply \\(\\frac{1}{256}\\) and 4:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = V^3 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nSo we have:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} \\]\n\nWe know that \\( 2048 = 8^3 \\), so:\n\n\\[ V = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",

        "critique": "1. Key Concepts and Correct Approach  \nWe are told that the pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V. Mathematically, this is expressed as  \nP = k A V\u00b3,  \nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\n\n2. Checking the Student\u2019s Steps  \n\u2022 The student correctly sets up the joint variation formula: P = k A V\u00b3.  \n\u2022 When V = 8 mph and A = 2 sq ft, P = 4 lb is given. Substituting these values, the student obtained  \n  4 = k \u22c5 2 \u22c5 8\u00b3.  \n  Since 8\u00b3 = 512, the student correctly calculated k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.  \n\n\u2022 In the second case, P = 32 lb, A = 4 sq ft, and the same formula is used:  \n  32 = (1/256) \u22c5 4 \u22c5 V\u00b3  \u2192  32 = (4/256) V\u00b3  \u2192  32 = (1/64) V\u00b3.  \n  Multiplying both sides by 64 gives  \n  32 \u22c5 64 = V\u00b3  \u2192  2048 = V\u00b3.  \n\n\u2022 Error: The student asserted 2048 = 8\u00b3, which is incorrect because 8\u00b3 = 512, not 2048. Hence, V = 8 is not correct.  \n\n3. Correct Solution  \nFrom 2048 = V\u00b3, we have  \nV = \u221b2048.  \nSince 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, its cube root is 2^(11/3) \u2248 12.7. Thus, the correct velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\n\\(\\boxed{ \\text{The correct wind velocity is } \\sqrt[3]{2048} \\approx 12.7 \\text{ mph.} }\\)\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
