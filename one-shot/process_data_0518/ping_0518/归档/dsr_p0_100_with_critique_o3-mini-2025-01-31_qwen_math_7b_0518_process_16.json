Then, use the found k to solve for the new velocity when P = 32 pounds and A = 4 ft\u00b2.\n\nStep 2: Checking the Student\u2019s Work\n1. The student sets up the relationship correctly:\n\u2003\u2003P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3.\n2. Substituting P = 4, A = 2, and V = 8 gives:\n\u2003\u20034 = k\u00b72\u00b78\u00b3.\n3. The student computes 8\u00b3 = 512 and then writes:\n\u2003\u20034 = k\u00b72\u00b7512 \u2192 4 = 1024k.\n\u2003Thus, k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n4. For the second situation, the student substitutes P = 32, A = 4, and k = 1/256 to obtain:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256)\u00b74\u00b7V\u00b3,\n\u2003\u2003which simplifies to 32 = (4/256)V\u00b3 = (1/64)V\u00b3.\n5. Multiplying both sides by 64 gives:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048.\n6. The student then writes:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048,\n\u2003claiming that 2048 = 8\u00b3, so V = 8.\n\u2003\u2003This is incorrect because 8\u00b3 = 512, not 2048.\n\nStep 3: Correcting the Error and Providing the Correct Solution\nWe correctly compute V as follows:\n\u2022 We have V\u00b3 = 2048. Notice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9.\n\u2022 Therefore, taking the cube root,\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\nThus, the correct wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\nFinal Answer:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8 \\cdot 2^{2/3}}\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",

        "critique": "Step 1: Key Concepts and Correct Approach\n\u2022 The problem states that P varies jointly as A and V\u00b3, which means the relationship is given by P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2022 To solve the problem, first find the constant k using the first set of conditions, then use that value along with the second set of conditions to solve for V.\n\nStep 2: Checking the Student's Steps\n1. The student correctly wrote: P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n2. Plugging in the values when V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.\n3. The student computed 8\u00b3 = 512 and then got:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024, leading to k = 4/1024 = 1/256. (This is correct.)\n4. The student then used the second condition (P = 32 lb, A = 4 ft\u00b2) to set up:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3, which simplifies to 32 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n5. Multiplying both sides by 64 gives:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048.\n6. The error arises in the final cube root step. The student wrote V = \u221b2048 = 16, but:\n\u2003\u200316\u00b3 = 4096, not 2048. In reality, 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so the cube root is V = 2^(11/3). Numerically, 2^(11/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) which is approximately 12.7.\n\nStep 3: Correct Solution and Final Answer\nFrom V\u00b3 = 2048, we take the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048 = 2^(11/3).\nThus, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{11/3}}\u2003(mph)\nor approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
