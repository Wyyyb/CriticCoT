We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can substitute these values into the equation to find \\( k \\):\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nNow substitute 512 for \\( 8^3 \\) in the equation:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nSimplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo find \\( k \\), divide both sides by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use the equation \\( P = \\frac{1}{256} A V^3 \\) to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. Substitute \\( P = 32 \\) and \\( A = 4 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nSimplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{4}{256} V^3 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V^3 \\), multiply both sides by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nCalculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nSo we have:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), take the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]",

        "critique": "1. Key Concepts and Correct Approach:\n   \u2022 The problem states that pressure (P) varies jointly as area (A) and the cube of velocity (V), i.e. P = k A V\u00b3.  \n   \u2022 Given values allow one to solve for the constant of proportionality k, then substitute new values to find the required velocity.\n\n2. Checking the Student\u2019s Steps:\n   \u2022 The student correctly wrote P = k A V\u00b3.  \n   \u2022 They correctly substituted P = 4, A = 2, and V = 8 to get 4 = k \u00d7 2 \u00d7 8\u00b3 \u21d2 4 = 1024k \u21d2 k = 1/256.  \n   \u2022 They correctly set up 32 = (1/256) \u00d7 4 \u00d7 V\u00b3 \u21d2 32 = (1/64) V\u00b3 \u21d2 V\u00b3 = 2048.  \n   \u2022 Here, the student\u2019s final step incorrectly concluded that the cube root of 2048 is 12. Actually, 12\u00b3 = 1728, while 13\u00b3 = 2197. 2048 is 2\u00b9\u00b9, so its cube root is 2^(11/3) \u2248 12.699, not 12.\n\n3. Correct Solution:\n   \u2022 From V\u00b3 = 2048, we get V = \u00b3\u221a(2048) = 2^(11/3) \u2248 12.699.  \n   \u2022 So the correct velocity is approximately 12.699 miles per hour.\n\n\\(\\boxed{V \\approx 12.699 \\text{ miles per hour}}\\)\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
