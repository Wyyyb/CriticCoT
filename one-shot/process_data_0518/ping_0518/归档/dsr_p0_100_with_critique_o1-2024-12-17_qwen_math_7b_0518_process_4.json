Key Concepts and Correct Approach  \n\u2022 The pressure P depends on area A and the cube of velocity V via P = k A V\u00b3, where k is a constant.  \n\u2022 Use the given data to solve for k, then substitute the values for the second scenario and solve for V.\n\n2. Checking the Student's Steps  \n\u2022 The student correctly sets up the relationship P = k A V\u00b3.  \n\u2022 Substitutes P = 4, A = 2, V = 8 to get 4 = k \u00d7 2 \u00d7 8\u00b3. This leads to 4 = k \u00d7 2 \u00d7 512 = 1024k.  \n\u2022 Hence k = 4/1024 = 1/256 (this part is correct).  \n\u2022 For the second scenario: P = 32, A = 4 \u2192 32 = (1/256) \u00d7 4 \u00d7 V\u00b3 \u2192 32 = 4V\u00b3 / 256 \u2192 Multiply both sides by 256:  \n  8192 = 4V\u00b3  \n  V\u00b3 = 2048.  \n\u2022 Next, the student states 2048 = 8\u00b3, but 8\u00b3 = 512, not 2048. Thus the final step is incorrect.  \n\n3. Correct Solution  \n\u2022 We have V\u00b3 = 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9. Since 2\u00b3 = 8 and 8\u00b3 = 512, 2048 is not a perfect cube of an integer. To find V, take the cube root:  \n  V = \u221b2048 = 2^(11/3).  \n\u2022 Numerically, this is approximately 12.7 miles per hour (since 12\u00b3 = 1728 and 13\u00b3 = 2197, 2048 is between these values).  \n\nTherefore, the correct wind velocity is:  \n\\(\\boxed{\\sqrt[3]{2048} \\approx 12.7 \\text{ miles per hour}}\\)\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
