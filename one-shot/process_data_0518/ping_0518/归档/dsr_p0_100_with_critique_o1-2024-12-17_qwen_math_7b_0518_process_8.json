Checking the Student\u2019s Work Step by Step  \n   - They correctly set up the equation P = k A V\u00b3.  \n   - Substituted P = 4, A = 2, and V = 8 to get 4 = k \u00d7 2 \u00d7 512, leading to k = 1/256.  \n   - They correctly substituted P = 32, A = 4, and k = 1/256 to get 32 = (1/256) \u00d7 4 \u00d7 V\u00b3.  \n   - Thus 32 = (4/256) V\u00b3, i.e. 32 = (1/64) V\u00b3.  \n   - Then V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048.  \n   - The mistake: The student concluded V = 8 from V\u00b3 = 2048, but 8\u00b3 = 512 \u2260 2048.

            "solution": "To solve the problem, we start by expressing the relationship between the pressure \\( P \\), the area \\( A \\), and the wind's velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. We substitute \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} \\]\n\nWe know that \\( 2048 = 8^3 \\), so:\n\n\\[ V = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{8}\\) miles per hour.",

Key Concepts and Correct Approach\n\n\u2022 The problem states that pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V.

However, 8\u00b3 = 512, not 2048. Thus, the student has made an error in this final step.\n\n3. Correct Solution\n\nFrom V\u00b3 = 2048, we have:  \nV = \u221b(2048) = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3) \u2248 12.7  \n\nHence, the correct wind velocity is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\n\\(\\boxed{12.7 \\text{ miles per hour (approximately)}}\\)\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
