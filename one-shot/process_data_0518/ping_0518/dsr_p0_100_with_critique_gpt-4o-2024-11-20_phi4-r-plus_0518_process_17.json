            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" \n\nWe have relationship: P = k * A * V^3. We can solve for k using given data: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 =512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow use second condition: P=32, A=4, unknown V. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, then simplify: 4/256 = 1/64, so equation becomes: 32 = (1/64) * V^3, multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32 * 64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11, because 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 equals 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But we want a number. Alternatively, we can find approximate: cube root of 2048 is approximately? Let's compute: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But we can simplify exactly: V = 2^(11/3). Alternatively, we can see: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) which is not an integer. Alternatively, we can solve exactly: V = cube root of 2048. Let me check: 2048 = 16 * 128, no, that's not simpler. Alternatively, note: 8 * 2^(2/3) is the simplest form. Alternatively, if we want decimal approximate: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, which is about 1.5874, times 8 equals 12.699, so approximately 12.70 mph. But maybe answer in exact form: 2^(11/3) mph. But let me check: 2^(11/3) mph is exactly equal to 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can also write V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want simplest form: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me double-check: V^3 = 2048, cube root of 2048 equals 2048^(1/3) = 2^(11/3) mph. So answer.\n\nI'll provide answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ miles per hour}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with explanation.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003Substitute these into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince (8)\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 miles per hour\n\nFor an approximate numerical value:\n\u2003\u2003\u221b4 \u2248 1.5874, so\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}",

            "solution": "We are given: The pressure P is proportional to area A and cube of velocity V. So P = k * A * V^3. Given: When V = 8 mph, A = 2 square feet, P = 4 pounds. So we have 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). Now 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So we have: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so solve for V. Multiply: 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, then multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3, i.e. 2048 = V^3. So V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10 = 1024, 2^11 = 2048, so V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can compute cube root of 2048 exactly: cube root of 2048 = 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 approximates 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048? Actually, let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7 = 161.29, times 12.7 equals 2047.83, which is close to 2048. But the exact answer is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph. However, let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66667) = e^(3.66667 * ln2) = e^(2.54) = 12.7. So answer: wind velocity is cube root of 2048 mph. But we can simplify: 2^(11/3) mph = 8*2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: Actually, note that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, so answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph. But let me check: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, then times 8 gives 12.6992 mph. So answer: Approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: V = cube root of (32 * 256 /4)? Let's recalc: Actually, let me re-check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4 V^3, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or 2^(11/3) mph. That is the answer.\n\nThus final answer: wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph.

So plug in: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. So constant k = 1/256.\n\nNow we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So use: 32 = (1/256)* 4 * V^3. So solve for V. Multiply: 4 * V^3 / 256 = V^3 / 64. So equation: 32 = V^3 / 64. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then find cube root of 2048. Factor: 2048 = 2^? Actually, 2048 = 2^11. Because 2^10=1024, so 2^11=2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4. So V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want a decimal approximate. Alternatively, we can compute cube root of 2048. Alternatively, note that 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so V is between 12 and 13 mph. But wait, check: 8 * cube root of 4. Actually, cube root of 4 is approx 1.5874, so 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699. But let's check: 12.699^3? Actually, let me compute precisely: cube root of 2048 = 2048^(1/3). But maybe we want exact expression. But the problem likely expects answer: V = cube root of 2048 = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Let's check: 8^3 = 512, then 4^3 = 64, product equals 512*64=32768, no. Let me recompute: 2^(11/3) is the simplest expression. Alternatively, express as 2^(11/3) mph. But note: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or about 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let's check: Actually, 2^(2/3) equals cube root of 4, yes.\n\nWe can also express as: V = (32*64)^(1/3) = (2048)^(1/3). So answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph.\n\nI can compute: cube root of 2048. 2^(11/3) is the exact answer. Let me compute approximate value: 2^(11/3) = exp((11/3)*ln2) = exp(11/3*0.693147) = exp(2.541) = 12.69 mph approx.\n\nThus final answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce final answer as: V = 2^(11/3) mph, or about 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}.

Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lbs:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048, so\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So the formula is: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when velocity is 8 mph, area is 2 square feet, pressure is 4 pounds. So: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = 1024k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Next, find velocity when pressure is 32 pounds and area is 4 square feet. So 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3. That is: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048. Then V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)? Wait, check: 2^11 = 2048, then cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). But we can also check: 8^3 =512, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's not a whole number. Wait, but maybe it is a whole number? Let's recalc: 32 = (1/64)*V^3 => V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, and cube root of 2048 =? Let's check: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But perhaps the problem expects an exact answer in radical form. Alternatively, maybe we made a mistake: Let's re-read: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4, so 4= k * 2 * 512 = 1024k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3, i.e., 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3). We can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3+2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want decimal approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so velocity is about 8*1.5874= 12.699 mph, which is about 12.7 mph. But the problem might be expecting an exact answer in radical form. But wait, maybe we misinterpret: \"cube of the wind's velocity\" means V^3, so that's what we did.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). But that is not a nice integer. Let's check: 2^(11/3) is not integer because 11 is not divisible by 3. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer as \"2^(11/3)\" mph or \"8 * 2^(2/3)\" mph. But maybe the problem expects a simplified radical form. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a numeric approximation: \"Approximately 12.7 mph.\" But the problem is from a typical algebra joint variation problem, so probably they want an exact answer in simplest radical form. Let's see: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3)*2^(2/3)= 2^3*2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of (2^2)= 8* cube root of 4 mph.\n\nSo answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph. But wait, let me double-check: 32 = (1/64)* V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, cube root of 2048 =? 2^11 = 2048, so cube root = 2^(11/3)= 2^3 *2^(2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root(4). Yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= (2^(1/3))^2, but that doesn't simplify further. So answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nLet's check if there's a possibility that the joint variation constant might be computed as: k = P/(A V^3) = 4/(2*512)= 4/1024= 1/256, so then for the second scenario: 32 = (1/256)*4* V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64= 2048, yes.\n\nThus answer: V = cube root (2048) mph, which is 8 cube root (4) mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph, or approximately \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a final message.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a final message: \"Answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce final answer in a final message.

When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nStep-by-step: Let P = k * A * V^3. Use given: when V=8, A=2, P=4, then 4 = k * 2 * 8^3, so k = 4/(2*512) = 4/(1024) = 1/256. So k=1/256.\n\nNow find V when A=4, P=32, so equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 V^3, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (8192)/4 = 2048. Wait check: Actually 32*256 = 8192, then 8192/4=2048. So V^3 = 2048. But 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^11=2048, yes. So V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can express it as 8*(cube root of 4). But is that answer acceptable? Let's check: Alternatively, we can compute cube root of 2048. But maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*(2^(2/3)). But maybe we want a decimal approximate value. Alternatively, we can also solve: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7? Let's check: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But is the answer expected in radical form? Alternatively, we can write V = 8* cube root of 4. But wait, check: 8*(cube root of 4) = 8* (cube root of 4). But wait, cube root of 4 = 4^(1/3) and 8=2^3, so that equals 2^(3+2/3)=2^(11/3). Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify further? 2^(11/3)= 2^(9/3+2/3)=2^3*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). That is the exact answer. Alternatively, if we want a decimal, approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, then times 8 is about 12.6992 mph. But the problem likely expects an exact answer: V=8* cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: Wait, check: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8*(cube root of 4) mph. That is the answer.\n\nWait, let me re-check: k=1/256, then for new condition: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (8192)/4=2048, so V = cube root of 2048. 2048= 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph or 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now provide final answer.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce answer in final message with final answer in box. I'll produce answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}. Alternatively, \\boxed{2^{11/3}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer. We'll produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer in final message.\n\nI'll produce answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant of variation k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003So, 4 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024.\n\u2003\u2003Thus, k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 256:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20038192 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Divide both sides by 4:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192/4 = 2048.\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048.\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\nThus, the wind velocity is 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) miles per hour.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}",
