            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. So we have P = k * A * V^3. When V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So plug in: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So the relation is P = (1/256)*A*V^3. Now find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32 * 64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Now take cube root: cube root of 2048 equals? Let's factor: 2048 = 2^? Actually 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we might want to simplify further. Alternatively, we can write as V = 8 * cube root of 4. But is that simplified? Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, so V approx 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph, approx 12.7 mph. But maybe the answer is best left as cube root of 2048. Alternatively, we can simplify as 8* cube root of 4 mph. But wait, let me check: 2^(11/3) equals 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. But maybe they want an exact expression. But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) is the same as cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can say V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = (2^3) * (2^(2/3)) = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But is that the simplest? Alternatively, we can simplify 2048 = 2^11. The cube root is 2^(11/3). So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = (2^(2/3)) * 2^3 = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is acceptable.\n\nHowever, note: It is possible to simplify further if we express as 8* cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as V = 8 * (cube root of 4) mph.\n\nWait, but maybe we can simplify: The cube root of 4 is not a rational number. So the answer remains in radical form.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify 2^(11/3) mph. But I want to check if it's intended to be an exact answer. Let me re-read the problem: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = approx 12.7 mph. But I'll leave answer as 8 cube root of 4 mph or 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI want to check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. That is acceptable.\n\nWait, but I can check: 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, if we want an approximate value, it's about 12.7 mph. But I'll leave answer in exact form.\n\nI'll also check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, and cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ miles per hour}} or \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ miles per hour}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. I'll produce answer as: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll produce answer in a final message with explanation. We'll produce final answer in boxed final answer.\n\nI'll produce answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the provided data:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb:\nNow, substitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}",

            "solution": "We are given: Pressure P is jointly varying with area A and cube of velocity V. So we have P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when velocity is 8 mph and area is 2, pressure is 4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. Now second scenario: Pressure is 32 pounds, area is 4 square feet, unknown velocity V. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. That equals (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. So then equation: 32 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Factor: 2048 = 2^11? Actually, 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: V = cube root(2048). But maybe we want a decimal approximation: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * cube root(4) = 8 * approx 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approximately. But let me check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4 approx 1.5874, so answer is 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But maybe the answer expects exact value: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can also write it as 2^(11/3) mph. But perhaps a simpler representation: The cube root of 2048 is 12.7 mph approx.\n\nLet's double-check: if velocity is 12.7 mph, then pressure becomes 1/256 * 4 * (12.7^3). But 12.7^3 is about 2048, so that yields 4 * 2048/256 = 4 * 8 = 32. So it's correct.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nWait, I'm re-checking: Actually, 12.7 mph is approximate. But wait, 12.7 mph is the velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Let me check: For V=12.7 mph, then V^3 is 12.7^3 = 2048 approx. Then pressure = (1/256)*4*(2048)= (4*2048)/256 = 8192/256 = 32. So it's correct.\n\nBut let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3) mph. So answer: wind velocity = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.6666)= 12.7 mph approx.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also write: V = cube root of (32 * 64) mph = cube root of 2048 mph, which is exactly that.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph} \\approx 12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer accordingly.

This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003Substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when P = 32 pounds and A = 4 ft\u00b2:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b(4) mph\n\nFor a numerical approximation:\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) \u2248 1.5874, so\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph} \\quad (\\text{approximately } 12.7 \\text{ mph})}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. When V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So then find k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now find V when A=4, P=32: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. Now find V = cube root of 2048. But 2048= 2^11? Let's check: 2^11=2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can simplify further: 2^(11/3)=? Wait, maybe we can simplify: 2048 = 8^3? Actually, check: 8^3=512, so not. Let's see: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096. So not exactly. So answer: V = cube root of 2048. Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can simplify further: cube root of 4 is not rational. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 8 * 1.5874= 12.699 mph approx. But let's see: 2^(2/3)= (2^(1/3))^2. The cube root of 2 is approx 1.26, squared equals 1.587. So answer: approx 12.7 mph.\n\nWait check: (8 mph? Actually, we want V when A=4, P=32. Let's check: if V=12.7 mph, then V^3= approx 12.7^3= 2048, exactly, so that's consistent.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWe can also express as: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer in text.

This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the value of k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant factors:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 mph\n\nIf you prefer a decimal approximation, note that \u221b4 is approximately 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. So the relation is P = k A V^3. Given: when velocity = 8 mph, area = 2 ft^2, pressure = 4 lb, then we have 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. Solve: k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So 32 = k * 4 * V^3. Using k = 1/256, so 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply: (1/256)*4 = 4/256 = 1/64. So equation: 32 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048: 2048 = 2^11. Cube root: cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But we want a simpler answer? Possibly as cube root of 2048. Alternatively, we can compute approximate: cube root of 2048 approximates to? Actually, 8^3 = 512, 16^3 = 4096. So it's between 8 and 16, but more precisely: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 12.7 approx. Wait, let's recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * (cube root of 4) ~ 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992. But perhaps the problem expects answer as cube root of 2048 mph? But we can simplify: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as 8 * (2^(2/3)). But I'm not sure if the problem expects an exact answer or a decimal approximation. The problem is from a joint variation problem. It might be acceptable to leave answer as cube root of 2048 mph. But let me check: The problem states \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph, which simplifies to 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can write: V = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: about 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, check: 8* cube root of 4 = 8*(4^(1/3)) = 8*(1.5874) = 12.699. But wait, the problem is from a joint variation problem and likely expects answer as: V = cube root of 2048 mph, which simplifies to 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But is that acceptable? Let me check: P = k A V^3, k = 1/256, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, then V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph. So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph. Let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.66666) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Yes.\n\nWe can also express as: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That's the simplest exact form.\n\nI'll answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box.

This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb:\n\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003\u20038\u00b3 = 512, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003We are told that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply (1/256) by 4:\n\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2048)\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003This can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b(4)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph} \\quad \\text{(approximately 12.70 mph)}}",

When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have given: P \u221d A * V^3. So P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: when V=8, A=2, P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we want: when A=4, P=32, find V such that: 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. So multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor: 2048 = 2^11. So cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe simpler: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But likely we want numeric approximate value? 2^(11/3) = exp((11/3)*ln2) = exp( (11/3)*0.6931) = exp(2.540) = 12.7 approx. But let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 2048? Let's compute approximate: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = (161.29) * 12.7 = 2048.383? Yes approximate.\n\nBut maybe we want exact form: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But is that the simplest form? Possibly answer: The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, let's check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as: V = 2^(11/3). Let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or about 12.7 mph. But wait, check: 2^11 = 2048, cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, but let me check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut the problem might be solved in steps: Let k be constant, then solve for k, then solve for V. So answer: V = cube root of (32*256/4)? Let's check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer with steps.

Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2.

            "solution": "We are given that pressure P varies jointly as area A and cube of wind's velocity V. So formula: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 sq ft, P=4 pounds, so we have 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when A=4 sq ft, P=32 pounds. Use formula: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, i.e. 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, if we need a decimal approximate: cube root of 4 is approx 1.5874, so V approx 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699, or 12.70 mph. But check: Actually, 8^3=512, so with k=1/256, then P= (1/256)*4*(V^3) = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. So 32= V^3/64, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048. Let's simplify: 2048= 2^11, cube root is 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer is 8*2^(2/3) mph. That is the exact answer.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.
