            "solution": "We are given: Pressure P varies jointly as area A and cube of wind velocity V. So we have equation: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, pressure =4 pounds, then k can be computed: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 *512 = k *1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow, question: find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. So using formula: 32 = (1/256)* 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11 because 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 is 8 * cube root of 4? Let's check: Actually, 2048= 8^3? Wait, 8^3=512, not 2048. Let's re-check: 8^3=512, but 16^3=4096, so it's in between. So answer: V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, write as 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). But maybe we want decimal approximate: 2^(2/3)= approximately 1.5874, so product approx 12.6 mph. But I'll leave answer in exact form.\n\nBut wait, check: 2^(11/3) = cube root of 2048. Alternatively, can we simplify? Because 2048 = 2^11, then cube root = 2^(11/3) mph. That is the answer. Alternatively, we can say V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. Or we can express as 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI can check: 2^(11/3)= (2^3)^(11/9)? That is not simpler. Alternatively, I can say V = 2^(11/3) mph. Let me see if we can simplify fraction: 11/3 is not simplified further.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that if V^3=2048, then V=\u221b2048. But I want to check: 2048/8=256, not sure.\n\nI can check: If V=12 mph, then V^3=1728, too small. If V=13 mph, then V^3=2197, too big. So the answer is between 12 and 13 mph, about 12.6 mph. Let me check: cube root of 2048 precisely: using calculator, cube root of 2048= about 12.7 mph maybe. Let me compute: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7*12.7 = (161.29)*12.7= 2048.083, yes.\n\nWait, I'll re-check: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7=161.29, multiplied by 12.7= 2048.083. So yes. But the exact answer is 2^(11/3) mph, which is acceptable.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI must include the answer in a box: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce the answer in the required final answer. We'll produce final answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce the explanation: Let P=kAV^3, given P=4 when A=2, V=8, so k= 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). Alternatively, approximate V ~ 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box. We'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}. We'll produce final answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce final answer in the required format: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Let me denote the relationship: P = k * A * V^3. Given P=4, A=2, V=8, then 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So the equation is: P = (1/256) * A * V^3. Now we are given: when A=4, P=32, solve for V: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (32*64) = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4, but that's not a nice integer. Let's check: 8^3=512, 10^3=1000, 11^3=1331, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13, but maybe there is a nice answer? Alternatively, we can solve: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 8* cube root of 4, as we computed. But maybe we can simplify: cube root of 4 = 4^(1/3). Alternatively, we can note that 2048 = 2^11, so cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 4 = cube root of (2^2) = 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can approximate: 2^(2/3) ~ 2^(0.6667)= approx 1.5874, so product is 8*1.5874 = 12.699. So about 12.70 mph. But perhaps they want the exact answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or 16 * cube root of (1/2) mph? Let me check: Actually, 8* cube root of 4 mph. We can also express as 16 * cube root of (1/2) mph? Let's check: cube root of (1/2) = 1/(cube root of 2) = 1/2^(1/3), so 16*(1/2^(1/3)) = 16/2^(1/3) = 8*2^(2/3)? Actually, 16/2^(1/3)=16*2^(-1/3)=8*2^(2/3) yes. So answer is same.\n\nWait, check: 8* cube root of 4 mph is the simplest.\n\nLet me check: Possibly the answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can rationalize: cube root of 4 mph = 4^(1/3) mph. So answer: V = 8 * 4^(1/3) mph.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want a decimal approximation: approx 12.70 mph. But the problem is likely from an algebra course where they want the answer in terms of cube roots. Let me check: \"The pressure P varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k A V^3. Given data: P=4, A=2, V=8, so k = 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then new scenario: P=32, A=4, so 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64=2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 8 cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is the exact answer.\n\nI can simplify cube root of 4 as 2^(2/3) so answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3)= 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nWe can also write it as 8 * cube root of 4 mph. I'll give answer as: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. But I'll check: 8\u221b4 = 8*(4^(1/3)) mph.\n\nI can also check: 4^(1/3) approximately equals 1.5874, multiplied by 8 equals 12.699 mph, which is correct.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.

Then find V when A=4, P=32: so 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Now find cube root: cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) is not an integer. Alternatively, note that 2048 = 8^3? Wait, check: 8^3 = 512, not 2048. 16^3 = 4096, so no. So answer is V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). We can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can write approximate value: 2^(2/3) approx equals 1.5874, times 8 equals 12.699, so approximately 12.7 mph. But maybe we want an exact answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express as 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Let me check: Actually, check: cube of (8 * 2^(2/3)) equals 512 * 2^(2) equals 512*4 = 2048. So yes. But maybe a simpler expression: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But that's not simpler. Let me check: Actually, cube root of 4 is the same as 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8* cube root of 4 mph, or V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: wind velocity is cube root of (32*64/4)? Wait, I'll recompute: Given equation: 32 = k * 4 * V^3, and k = 1/256, so 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). That is the answer.\n\nLet's check: 2^(11/3) mph. We can also express that as 2^(3+2/3)=8 *2^(2/3) mph, which is approximately 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699 mph approx. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can simplify: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3) mph. That is the exact answer.\n\nThus answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. I'll check the problem statement: \"wind velocity\" but it's in mph. So answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI must check: Wait, check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3)=8 * cube root of 2^2=8* cube root of 4 mph. So answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI must produce final answer in final answer box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}. That is the answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer. We'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = 1024k\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003Now, when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we can write:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 mph\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P is jointly proportional to area A and cube of velocity V. So: P = k A V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4. So find constant k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 =512. So k=4 / (2*512) = 4 /1024 = 1/256. So then P = (A V^3)/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when pressure is 32, sail area=4. So equation: 32 = (4 V^3)/256 => Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4 V^3, compute: 32*256 =8192? Let's check: 32*256 =8192, then divide by 4: V^3=8192/4=2048. So find V: V = cube root of 2048. Factor: 2048 = 2^? 2048= 2^11? Actually, 2^11=2048. So cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But that is not a nice integer. Let me check: maybe I did something wrong. Let's check: 8 mph gives P=4 for A=2. That gives k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. So then for A=4, P=32, equation: 32 = (4 * V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4 V^3, 32*256 =8192, so V^3=8192/4=2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^11. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). That is not a nice integer. Let me check if maybe the problem expects answer in terms of radical or maybe we can simplify: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer is V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can simplify further: 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, cube root of 2048 is 12.7 mph approx. Let me compute: cube root of 2048 is approx: 12.7 mph. But maybe the answer expects a fractional expression. Let me check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. But let me check: 8*2^(2/3)=8* (approx 1.5874)=12.699 mph approx. Alternatively, we can write answer: V= 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWait, I must check if the problem expects an answer as an exact expression or maybe we can simplify further: 8\u221b4 mph is acceptable.\n\nWait, let me re-read the question: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph. Alternatively, if we want to express in terms of radical: 8\u221b4 mph. But let me check: Actually, we can simplify: 2^(2/3)= (4)^(1/3) so answer: V=8*(4)^(1/3) mph. Alternatively, V= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, maybe we can simplify: 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can rationalize: Let x = cube root of 4. So answer: 8x mph. Alternatively, we can express as: 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can also express as: V= 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can express as: V = 2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). There's no simpler expression.\n\nI can check: (8*2^(2/3))^3 = 8^3 * 2^2 =512*4=2048, correct.\n\nSo answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 8 mph gives 4 pounds, 16 mph gives 128 pounds? Let's test: if A=2, then P = (2*16^3)/256 = (2*4096)/256=8192/256=32, so yes.\n\nNow, let me check: Possibly the constant is misinterpreted: \"varies jointly as\" means P = k A V^3. So that's correct.\n\nSo answer: V=8\u221b4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me re-read the question: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So indeed, P = k A V^3. So answer: V=8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI can also solve: V^3 = (P*256)/A. For given P=32, A=4, then V^3 = (32*256)/4= (32*256)/4 =32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify: 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nMaybe we can simplify further: cube root of 4 is not rational.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.

Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, then P=4 pounds. So we can find constant k: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So the formula becomes: P = (1/256)* A * V^3.\n\nNow we want: find V when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3. Multiply both sides: 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048: 2^11. So V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8* 2^(2/3). But maybe we want a decimal approx. But maybe they want an exact answer: V = 8 * cube root(4)? Let's check: 2^(2/3) = cube root(2^2)= cube root(4). So answer: V = 8 cube root(4) mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate: cube root(4) ~ 1.5874, times 8 gives about 12.699 mph. But the question likely expects: wind velocity = 8 * cube root(4) mph, or maybe simplified as 8 * cube root(4) mph. Let me check: 8* cube root(4) mph is the answer. But let me check: 2^(11/3)= (2^(3))*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can write: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer is: wind velocity = 8 * cube root(4) mph. Alternatively, 2^(11/3) mph. Let me check: 2^(11/3)= (2^11)^(1/3)= (2048)^(1/3) = cube root of 2048. But it's not a nice integer.\n\nLet's check: 8^3=512, 9^3=729, 10^3=1000, 11^3=1331, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so 2048 is between 12^3 and 13^3, but the exact cube root is not an integer.\n\nWait, we can simplify: 2048= 2^11. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V=8 * 2^(2/3) mph. That is the answer. Alternatively, we can express as V=8 * cube root(4) mph. That is the answer.\n\nI can also check: 2^(2/3)= cube root(2^2)= cube root(4) mph.\n\nThus final answer: V= 8 * cube root(4) mph.\n\nWe can also express: V= 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer with explanation and final answer in box.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values.\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, the pressure P = 4 pounds. Substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds.\nSubstitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides.\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express this as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2\u00b2, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3. When velocity is 8 mph, pressure is 4 pounds for sail area 2 square feet. So 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nThen find wind velocity when pressure is 32 pounds for sail area 4 square feet. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Now compute cube root: cube root of 2048 equals? Let's see: 2048= 2^11. Cube root: (2^11)^(1/3)=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3) approximate value: 2^(2/3)= approx 1.5874. Then product= 8*1.5874=12.699. But maybe the answer is exactly expressed in radical form: V = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe they want a simplified answer. But let me check: maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11). Alternatively, we can write as: V = 8 * cube root of 4? Because 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph. But maybe they want a decimal approximate: V ~ 12.7 mph. But wait check: V^3 = 2048, then cube root of 2048: Let me check: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so indeed 12.7 mph. But wait: 8 cube root of 4 = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699. But is that the answer? Let's check: pressure = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3) ~? Let's check: 12.7^3 approx = 2048? yes.\n\nBut I want to see if there is an integer answer: maybe the answer is exactly 8* cube root of 4 mph. But wait, maybe we can simplify further: 8 cube root of 4 = 8 * (2^(2/3)) = 2^(3)*2^(2/3)=2^(11/3). That is the simplest form.\n\nHowever, maybe the answer is expressed as cube root of 2048? But 2048= 2^11, so answer is cube root of 2^11= 2^(11/3). So answer: V= 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, but let me re-read the question: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V= 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI must check: P = k A V^3, and k= 1/256, so P= (A V^3)/256. For given A=4, P=32, so equation: 32= (4 V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256: 32*256= 4 V^3, so V^3= (32*256)/4= (32*64)= 2048, so V= cube root of 2048. Yes.\n\nI can also simplify: 2048= 2^11, so V= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer in final message with box. I'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, we have\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, this becomes\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are given that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we need to find V. Substitute into the formula:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply 4 by 1/256:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nNow, solve for V\u00b3 by multiplying both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Find V by taking the cube root of 2048:\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 \u221b(4)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate value, note that \u221b4 is about 1.587, so\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}",
