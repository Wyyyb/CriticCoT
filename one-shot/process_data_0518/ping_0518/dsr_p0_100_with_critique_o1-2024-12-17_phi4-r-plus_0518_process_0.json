            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe are given: \"P varies jointly as A and V^3.\" So we have: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: When V=8 mph and A=2, P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). But 8^3=512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we are asked: when A=4 and P=32, find V. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11. Wait, 2^11 = 2048, so V^3 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666) but can be simplified further: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can find approximate value: 2^(2/3)= (cube root of 4) approximates 1.5874, so V approx= 8*1.5874= 12.699. But maybe the answer expects an exact form: 2^(11/3) mph, or \"8*2^(2/3) mph\", or maybe \"2^(11/3) mph\".\n\nBut perhaps we can check: 8*2^(2/3) mph. Let's check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, so answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can also write V = cube root (2048) mph. But perhaps we can simplify: 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) mph. But that is the simplest exact form. But perhaps we can rationalize it further: V = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3) mph. So answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want a decimal approximation: 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, but check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, yes.\n\nWe can also check: 2048 = 8^3? But 8^3=512, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13 mph. So answer: about 12.7 mph.\n\nBut wait, I need to double-check: The problem statement \"varies jointly as A and V^3\" means P = k A V^3. Yes.\n\nDouble-check: P=4 when A=2, V=8. Then 4 = k*2*512, so k=4/1024=1/256. Then for new situation: P=32, A=4, so 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4=32*64=2048. So V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: 8*2^(2/3) mph or cube root of 2048 mph. That is the answer.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\text{ mph} \\text{ or approximately } 12.7 \\text{ mph.}}\n\nI'll now produce answer with final answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box. I'll produce answer: \\boxed{8 \\cdot 2^{2/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer in text. We'll produce answer: The wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer.Since the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V, we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb, substitute these into the equation:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are given A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb, and we need to find V. Substitute the known values into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nSimplify the right side:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nSince 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (because 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is exactly 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) mph. In decimal form, this is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{8 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\text{ mph} \\text{ (approximately 12.7 mph)}}",

            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. That is, P = k * A * V^3. We are given: when V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, then P=4 pounds. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So 4= k *2*512 = k *1024. Then k=4/1024 = 1/256. So the constant is 1/256.\n\nNow we want: find wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So we have: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve for V. Multiply both sides: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor 2048: 2048= 2^11. So V=2^(11/3)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we want decimal approximations. Alternatively, note that 2^(11/3)= (2^(3+2/3)) = 8 * 2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 2^2= 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe they want an exact answer in radical form. Alternatively, note that the problem might be intended to produce a rational number. Wait, check: Actually, we had: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, and 2048=2^11. So V= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). That is the exact answer. But maybe they want a decimal approximation: cube root of 4 is approx 1.5874, so V approx 8*1.5874=12.699. But likely the answer is 8* cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps the problem expects answer: The wind velocity is 8*(cube root of 4) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph. However, maybe we want to simplify further. Alternatively, note that 2^(2/3)= (4)^(1/3). So answer: V = 8*(4)^(1/3) mph. Alternatively, we can check: 8*(cube root of 4)=8*1.5874=12.699. So answer: approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nDouble-check: if V=8 mph, then P= (1/256)*2*(512)= (1/256)*1024=4, so that's correct. And if V=8*(cube root of 4) mph, then V^3= 8^3*(cube root of 4)^3=512*4=2048, and then P= (1/256)*4*2048= (4/256)*2048= (1/64)*2048=32, correct.\n\nThus answer: V=8*(cube root of 4) mph, or V= 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.

            "solution": "We are given: The pressure P is joint variation: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when velocity V=8 mph, area A=2, pressure P=4. So: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024k. So k= 4/1024 = 1/256. Now second scenario: pressure P=32, area A=4, find velocity V. So: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve: 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, then V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11= 2048. So V = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity is 8* cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate numeric value: cube root of 4 approximates to 1.5874, then V approx equals 8*1.5874=12.6992 mph approx. But likely answer: 8\u221a[3]{4} mph or 8* cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut wait, check: Actually, 2^(11/3) equals 2^(3.6667) equals 12.7 mph approx. But wait, check: 2^(11/3)= (2^(3+2/3))=8*2^(2/3) equals 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is the same. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. But we can simplify further if we want: 8 cube root of 4 mph. But can we simplify further? Not really.\n\nWait, maybe we want an exact answer in radical form. Alternatively, we can write V = 8*(4)^(1/3). Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph. So answer: 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nLet me check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also check: 8 * cube root of 4 is approximately 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699 mph. Alternatively, we can solve the equation: V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. But that's not simpler than 2^(11/3). So answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI will now produce the answer.

When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nLet's denote: P = k * A * V^3. Given P=4, A=2, V=8, then 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. Compute 8^3 =512, then 2*512=1024, so equation is 4=1024k, then k=4/1024 = 1/256. Then find V when P=32, A=4, and k=1/256. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32= (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64= V^3. 32*64=2048, so V^3=2048. Then find cube root: cube root of 2048 =? Let's factor 2048: 2048 = 2^? 2^11=2048, since 2^11=2048. So V^3=2^11, then V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) but we want to simplify: 2^(11/3)=2^(9/3+2/3)=2^3 *2^(2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). But maybe we want to simplify further: Alternatively, note that V^3= 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = cube root of 8 * cube root of 256=2 * cube root of 256. But 256=2^8, so cube root of 256=2^(8/3)=2^(2.6666) not simpler. Let's recalc: V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so V=8* cube root of 4. But maybe the answer is expected as an integer? Let's check: 8^3=512, 9^3=729, 10^3=1000, 11^3=1331, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so 2048 is not a perfect cube. So answer is V= cube root of 2048, which is 2^(11/3). But wait, maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= 2^(9/3)*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8* cube root of 4. But the answer might be expressed as cube root of 2048 miles per hour. Alternatively, we can say V= 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nLet's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666)= about 12.0? Let's approximate: 2^(11/3)= e^( (11/3)*ln2)= e^(3.6666*0.693)= e^(2.54)= about 12.7 mph. Let's compute exactly: 2^(11/3)= (2^(1/3))^11, but not simpler.\n\nWait, recalc: 2^(11/3)= (2^(1/3))^11, but that doesn't simplify.\n\nMaybe we can express answer as: V = cube root of 2048 miles per hour. But maybe we want a decimal approximation: cube root of 2048 is approximately 12.7 mph. Let's check: 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7= 12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7= 2048.38 approx, so yes.\n\nWait, but I want to check: 4 square feet, 32 pounds, and k=1/256, so equation: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3 => V^3= (32*256)/4= (32*256)/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3)= approx 12.7 mph.\n\nI want to check: Actually, wait, re-read question: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k A V^3. Given: When velocity is 8 mph, pressure on sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. That yields k=4/(2*8^3)=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So equation: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). That is the exact value.\n\nWe can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)= (4)^(1/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut wait, is that the simplest? Alternatively, we can write V= 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nSo answer: V= 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can double-check: If V=12.7 mph, then V^3 approx=12.7^3 approx=2048, then P= (1/256)*4*2048= (4*2048)/256=8192/256=32, so yes.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph. But wait, let me recalc: 8*2^(2/3)=8*(2^(2/3)). But 2^(2/3)= approximately 1.5874, so product equals 8*1.5874=12.699 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph} \\approx 12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a neat answer.

Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are asked to find V when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply (1/256) by 4:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(9/3) \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nIf you wish to approximate the value, note that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, which is approximately 1.5874. Thus:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nSo, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph} \\quad \\text{(approximately } 12.7 \\text{ mph)}}",

            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. So P = k * A * V^3. Given when velocity=8 mph, area=2, pressure=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4 = k*2*512= k*1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now then find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so simplify: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64= V^3, so 2048= V^3, then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048: 2048= 2^11, cube root: V= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 2^3 *2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. But wait check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3) = 8 *2^(2/3). But is that the simplest? Alternatively, maybe we want to find a rational approximate value: cube root of 2048 approx? Actually, 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, so answer is between 8 and 16 mph. But let me compute: cube root of 2048= cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.66667)= 2^3.66667= around 12.7 mph? Wait recalc: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.66667)= 2^(3 + 0.66667)= 8*2^(0.66667). And 2^(0.66667) ~ 1.6 (since 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4 ~ 1.5874). So answer approx 8*1.5874= 12.699 mph. But we can leave answer as 2^(11/3) mph or as 8 cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: 8* cube root of 4 mph. But wait, is that exactly? Let's check: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8* 4^(1/3)= 8* (2^(2/3))= 8*2^(2/3)= 2^3*2^(2/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 2^(11/3). So that's the answer.\n\nHowever, check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.66667)= approximate value 12.7 mph. But let me check: using the equation: P= (1/256)*A*V^3, and plug A=4, then 32= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, and cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3). So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer accordingly.\n\nI'll now produce answer in text: \"We are given that P = k A V^3. Using initial conditions: 4 = k *2*(8^3) = k *2*512= k*1024, so k=4/1024=1/256. Then using the second scenario: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, and V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\"\n\nI'll now produce answer accordingly. I'll produce answer in a final message.\n\nI'll produce answer in text. I'll produce answer with final answer in a box: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}. But I'll produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}. Alternatively, I can produce answer in approximate form: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \"Thus, the wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce answer in text. I'll produce answer accordingly. We'll produce answer accordingly.\n\nI'll now produce answer in final message.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis is the exact value of the wind velocity. To express it in a slightly different form, note that:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we can also write:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nStep 4. Approximate the value:\n\u2003\u2003\u221b4 \u2248 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph} \\quad \\text{(approximately 12.7 mph)}}",
