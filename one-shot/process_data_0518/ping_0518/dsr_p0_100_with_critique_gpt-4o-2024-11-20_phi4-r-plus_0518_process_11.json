            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nLet's denote that P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant of proportionality. Given: When V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4 lbs, then 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4= k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then next: when A=4, P=32, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11=2048. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we might want a numerical answer: 2^(2/3) is approx 1.5874, so V approx 8*1.5874 = 12.699, but probably answer as cube root of 2048, or 8* cube root of 4? Wait, let's check: Actually, 2^(11/3) = (2^(1/3))^11? Wait, let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 +2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But we can also express that as 8*(cube root of 4) because 2^(2/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity = 8 cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nWait, let's check: 8^3=512, then P= (1/256)*2*512= (1/256)*1024=4, correct.\n\nSo answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4) mph.\n\nWe can also check: Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 8^3? Actually 8^3=512, not 2048. Let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7, approximate: 12.7^3 = 2048. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nBetter: V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nBut I can also note: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with explanation. We'll produce step-by-step explanation.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a neat format. We'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a neat format. We'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given data:\n\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003Substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given a physics problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. We are given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So compute constant k = P/(A*V^3) = 4/(2*(8^3)). But 8^3=512. So k = 4/(2*512) = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then the formula becomes P = (A * V^3)/256. Next, we are given: for A=4, P=32, find V. So equation: 32 = (4 * V^3)/256. Multiply both sides: 32*256 = 4 * V^3, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (8192)/4 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now compute cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V^3 = 2^11. So V = cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But perhaps we want the answer in simplest radical form? Alternatively, we can write cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256)= 2* cube root of 256? Let's try: 2048= 8*256, so cube root of 2048 = cube root of 8 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of 256. But cube root of 256= cube root of (2^8)= 2^(8/3)= 2^(2+2/3)= 4*2^(2/3). So that gives V=2*4*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But that is not simpler. Alternatively, we can express as 2^(11/3). But maybe we want a decimal approximation. Let's compute cube root of 2048. Cube root of 2048= approximate value: cube root of 2048= approximate: cube root of 2048= 12.7? Wait, let's compute: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so cube root is between 12 and 13, but more precisely: 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7= 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7=161.29, multiplied by 12.7 gives 2048.383, so it's approximately 12.7 mph. But wait, check: Actually, 12.7 mph is approximate. But we can check: 12.7^3= 2048.383, which is close to 2048. But we want exact value maybe in simplest radical form: V=2^(11/3). Alternatively, we can simplify: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). That is acceptable answer. But maybe we want a decimal approximation: about 12.7 mph. But the question says \"Find the wind velocity\", so answer: 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph. But let me re-check: P = k*A*V^3, given P=4 when A=2 and V=8, so k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for A=4 and P=32, equation: 32= (4*V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256: 32*256= 4V^3, so V^3= (32*256)/4= (32/4)*256=8*256=2048. So V= cube root of 2048= cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, so V=8* cube root of 4 mph. That is the same as 8* cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also express as: 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to simplify: cube root of 4 is not simpler than that.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.

            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as area A and cube of wind velocity V. That is, P = k A V^3 for some constant k. Then using the given data: when velocity is 8 mph, pressure on sail of area 2 sq ft is 4 pounds. So we get 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. Then we want to find velocity V when pressure on sail of area 4 sq ft is 32 pounds. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, i.e., V^3 = 2048. Then compute cube root of 2048. 2^11 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can write it as 8 * cube root of 4, but maybe we want a decimal approximation. But maybe we want to simplify. Let's check: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3).

But maybe the answer is expressed in radical form.\n\nWait, 2048 = 8 * 256, so cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = 2 * cube root of 256. But cube root of 256 = cube root of 2^8 = 2^(8/3) = 2^(2+2/3) = 4 * cube root of 4. That doesn't simplify nicely. Let's see: Alternatively, 2^(11/3) is the simplest answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can note: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity = 8 cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we can rationalize: Let cube root of 4 be left as is.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. But I'd like to give an exact answer in radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, let me check: k = 1/256. Then equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, yes.\n\nWe can simplify further: 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) mph. But we can also write it as 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Possibly the answer: wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, so 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That's the answer.\n\nThus final answer: wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with reasoning.\n\nI'll produce answer with step-by-step reasoning.\n\nI'll produce answer with final answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer in \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer with answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce answer with final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given data:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = 1024k\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003We are given A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given that pressure P is jointly proportional to the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. So we can express: P = k A V^3. Given when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4 pounds. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k= 4/1024 = 1/256. Then next we are asked: when A=4 square feet and P=32 pounds, find V. So we have: 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3. Then compute: (1/256)*4 = 4/256=1/64. So equation: 32 = (1/64) V^3, multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So then V = cube root of 2048. Now compute cube root: 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^11=2048, so V^3=2^11, then V=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V=8 cube root of 4 mph, but maybe we can compute approximate value: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so then V=8*1.5874=12.699, about 12.70 mph. But maybe the answer in exact form: 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, maybe we can simplify: Actually, wait check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer is: V=8 * 2^(2/3) mph. That is the answer. Let me check: if V=8*2^(2/3), then cube of that is (8^3)*(2^(2))=512*4=2048, and then times constant: (1/256)*4= 4/256=1/64, then product is 2048/64=32, which works.\n\nBut wait, let's check: 8^3=512, then 2*512=1024, so k=4/1024=1/256. Then for second case: P= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3= (32*256)/4= (8192)/4=2048, so yes.\n\nSo answer: V=8*2^(2/3) mph, which is exactly 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait, can we simplify further? 2^(2/3) is not a rational number. Alternatively, we can say V= 8\u221b4 mph. That is the exact answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can express as V=12.7 mph approx.\n\nThus final answer: V=8\u221b4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI can also check if the answer is supposed to be exactly expressed as cube root of 2048, which is 12.7 mph. But the given constants: P varies jointly as A and V^3. So I'm going to check: P= k A V^3, so k= P/(A V^3)= 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for second: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048. But cube root of 2048= cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8\u221b4. So answer.\n\nThus I'll answer: The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. I'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce answer in final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant of proportionality k using the given information:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003So, 4 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024.\n\u2003\u2003Thus, k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplify (1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64:\n\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048.\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048.\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we can also write:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nThus, the wind velocity is exactly 8\u221b4 miles per hour, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So the equation: P = k * A * V^3. Given data: when A=2, V=8, P=4. So substitute: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. Compute 8^3 = 512. So then 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So k=1/256.\n\nNow we want: when A=4, P=32, find V. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply out: 4/256=1/64. So equation: 32 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Now compute cube root of 2048. Factorize 2048: 2048=2^11? Actually 2^11=2048 exactly. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But that's not an integer. But maybe we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3)? But not a nice number. Wait, let's check: The problem might be expecting a rational number. Let's re-read problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" Possibly we might have misread \"cube\" as \"square\"? But it says \"cube of the wind's velocity\" which is V^3. Let's check: With given numbers: P = k * A * V^3. For A=2, V=8, then P= k * 2 * 512 = 1024k. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for A=4, P=32, equation becomes: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V = cube root of 2048. But cube root of 2048 is not a whole number. Let's compute approximate: cube root of 2048 = 12.7? Let's check: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But maybe the answer is expressed in radical form: V = 2^(11/3). But we can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3)=2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, can we express 2^(2/3) as cube root of 4? So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 miles per hour. But let me check: 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, can we express as cube root of 2048, but that is not simplified. Let's check: 8 * cube root of 4 is the same as cube root of (8^3 * 4) = cube root of (512*4)= cube root of 2048. So answer is V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait, maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 4 doesn't simplify to a rational number. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But let me check if the problem expects a numerical answer. Possibly the answer: \"8\u221b4 mph\" is acceptable. Let me check if we misinterpreted the \"cube\" as \"square\"? But it's given \"cube of the wind's velocity\" which is V^3. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pressure is directly proportional to V^2? But the problem explicitly says \"cube\" so it's V^3.\n\nLet me check: When V=8 mph, pressure=4 lbs on a 2 square foot sail. So k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for A=4, P=32, equation: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3=32*64=2048. So V= cube root of 2048. Factor 2048=2^11, so cube root equals 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8 cube root of (2^2)=8 cube root of 4 mph. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWe can approximate: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, so 8*1.5874=12.6992 mph approximately. So answer: about 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me check if the problem might be expecting an answer in exact form: \"8 cube root of 4 mph\" or \"2^(11/3) mph\" or \"cube root of 2048 mph.\" Possibly \"8\u221b4 mph\" is acceptable.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in boxed format. I'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}. However, I must check instructions: \"Please reason step by step and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" So I'll produce final answer in a final boxed answer.\n\nI'll produce step-by-step explanation. We'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer with explanation. We'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given data:\n\u2003\u2003When A = 2 ft\u00b2, V = 8 mph, and P = 4 lbs, substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = 1024k\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lbs.\n\u2003\u2003Substitute A = 4, P = 32, and k = 1/256 into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant factor:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus,\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2\u00b2 (which is 4), we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nSo, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",
