            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: When V = 8 mph, A = 2 square feet, P = 4 pounds. So substitute: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when P = 32 pounds and A = 4 square feet. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. So solve: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's see: 2048 = 2^11. Cube root: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) which is not a nice integer. But let's check: maybe it's 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8*(cube root of 4). So answer: wind velocity = 8*(cube root of 4) mph. Alternatively, if we want to approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so product is 8*1.5874 = 12.699, about 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me check: 8 mph gives pressure 4 lbs with 2 sq ft. Then 4 sq ft and 12.7 mph gives pressure: k * 4*(12.7^3) = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3) approximates? 12.7^3 = 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 2048. So indeed 32 lbs. So answer: wind velocity = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can write: wind velocity = 8*(cube root of 4) mph.\n\nWait, check: 4*(cube root of 4) = 4 * 1.5874 = 6.3496, but then multiplied by 8? Wait, let's recalc: Actually, 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * (cube root of 4) mph. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWe can also simplify: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.587, so answer is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a boxed format.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ miles per hour}}.\n\nI'll produce answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lbs, substitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lbs.\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nNow, solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Take the cube root of both sides to solve for V:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nRecognize that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) = \u221b(2\u00b2) = \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 mph\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}",

So plug: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = 1024k. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11, since 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So cube root: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can say V = cube root(2048) = 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe the answer is expressed as cube root of 2048, which simplifies to 8 * cube root of 4? Wait, check: cube root of 2048 = cube root (2^11) = 2^(11/3). We can write 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But is that simpler? Alternatively, we can write 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut is that the intended answer? Let me check: The problem statement: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So we got V^3 = 2048, V = cube root of 2048, which is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But let me see if there's a simpler expression: maybe it's better to simplify as: 32 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 mph = 2^(11/3) mph. That's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if we want a decimal approximation: 2^(11/3) approximates to 2^(3.6667) ~ 2^3.6667 = 2^3 * 2^(0.6667) = 8 * 1.6 = 12.8 mph approx. Actually, 2^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, so 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. So answer: about 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me recalc: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4 = approx 1.5874, times 8 equals approx 12.699 mph.\n\nHowever, I want to check: 8 mph was given for 2 square feet, 4 psi. For 4 square feet, 32 psi, the velocity must be higher. We got 12.7 mph, which is not a nice integer. But let's check the joint variation: P = k A V^3, k = 1/256. For A=4, V=12.7 mph, then V^3 = about 12.7^3 = 2048, times (4/256) = 32, yes.\n\nWait, but then the cube of 12.7 mph is about 2048 exactly? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 approximates to 12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7 = 2048.383, which is about 2048. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but I want to check if maybe we can express the answer in radical form: V = \u221b(2048) = \u221b(2^11) = 2^(11/3). That is the simplest exact answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify as: V = 8\u221b4 mph. But that's not simpler than 2^(11/3). Alternatively, we can express as: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWe can also express as: V = 4\u221b(16) mph, but that is not simpler.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is acceptable.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also express as: V = cube root of 2048 mph.\n\nI can check: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3).\n\nThus answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, approx 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in the required format: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a final answer box.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, then P = 4. So we can compute constant: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nThen find wind velocity when pressure P = 32, A = 4. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But perhaps we want a simpler answer? Alternatively, 2^(11/3) is not integer. But let me check: maybe I made error? Let me check: 4/256 = 1/64, then equation: 32 = (1/64)*V^3 => V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, cube root of 2048 =? 12.7 approx? Actually, 12.7^3 is approx 2048. But wait, maybe it's simpler: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root equals 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6667) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6667) = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is the exact expression. But maybe we can simplify further? 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, so answer is 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, but the problem might be expecting a numerical answer? Let me check: 2^(11/3) = cube root of (2^11) = cube root of (2048) = cube root of (2048) is not a nice integer. But perhaps I can see if the problem intended a nice answer. Let me re-read: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That is unusual: normally pressure is proportional to V^2, not V^3. But anyway. \"When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds.\" That gives constant. \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" That gives equation: 32 = k * 4 * V^3. And k = 1/256. Then 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). That is the answer. But maybe we can express 2^(2/3) as cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so V is about 8*1.5874 = 12.699, about 12.7 mph. But the problem might be expecting an exact answer. Possibly the answer is 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nLet me check: The constant is computed: k = P/(A*V^3) = 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256, then for second scenario: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). That's the answer.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's check: 2^(11/3) is not 12.7 mph exactly? Let's compute: cube root of 2048 = e^( (ln 2048)/3 ) = e^( (ln(2^11))/3 ) = e^( (11 ln2)/3 ) = 2^(11/3). 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, which is approximately 1.5874, so product is 12.699 mph, which is plausible.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can simplify further: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8 * (4^(1/3)). But that's not simpler.\n\nAlternatively, we can express as V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll provide the answer in the required format: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll also provide approximate value: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a final answer box.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are given a new situation where A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\nWe need the cube root of 2048. Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u00b2\u00b9\u00b9\u221a(2048) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}\n\nFor an approximate value, note that \u221b4 \u2248 1.587, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.7 mph.",

When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So the relationship is: P = k A V^3. Given: when V = 8, A=2, P=4, so we get: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. Now next: find V when A=4, P=32. So 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. We can simplify: 2048=2^? Let's factor: 2048=2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want a decimal approximation: cube root of 4 approx= 1.5874, so V approx= 8*1.5874=12.6992 mph approx. But maybe it's best to leave answer in exact form: V= 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 4 is not a rational number.

Wait, let me check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want an approximate value: approximately 12.7 mph. But question: \"Find the wind velocity\" likely expects an exact answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph or 8 cube root of 4 mph. But let me check: maybe they intended to get a nice number. Let's check: 8 mph yields pressure 4 pounds. For a sail of 4 square feet and 32 pounds, the ratio: P increased by factor 32/4=8, but area increased by factor 2, so the velocity factor must be cube root of (8/2) = cube root of 4. So velocity increases by factor cube root of 4, so 8*(cube root of 4) mph. That is the answer.\n\nWait, let me check: We have P1=4 = k * 2 * (8^3). Then k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for second case, P2=32= (1/256)*4* V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3). That is the answer.\n\nThus answer: V=2^(11/3) mph, or 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.

            "solution": "We are given a problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant of proportionality. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4, then 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512. So equation: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. Then k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow given: P=32, A=4, find V. So 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, and V = cube root of 2048. Let's simplify: 2048 = 2^11 (because 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048). So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). That can be written as 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. But maybe we want a decimal approx. Alternatively, note that 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = approximate value: 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * cube root of 2^2. Actually wait, let me recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, which is approximately 1.5874, so product is 8*1.5874 = 12.699, approx 12.7 mph. But let's check: 8* (cube root of 4) is exactly answer. Alternatively, we can also write as (cube root of 2048) mph. However, maybe we want answer in simplified radical form: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find a nicer simplification: 2^(11/3) is not a nice integer. So answer: The wind velocity is 8*\u221b4 mph. But wait, let's check: 8 mph gives pressure 4 pounds on 2 square feet. For 4 square feet and 32 pounds, the ratio: 32/4 = 8 times pressure, but area doubled from 2 to 4, so doubling area doubles pressure, so remaining factor 4 is due to velocity cubed factor. So velocity factor must be cube root of 4, so velocity is 8 times cube root of 4. But wait, check: Actually, we can solve: 32 = k * 4 * V^3, and k = 1/256, so then V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8^3 * something)? Wait, 8^3 =512, so not exactly.\n\nLet's check: 2048/512 = 4, so 2048 = 512*4, so cube root of 2048 = cube root of (512*4) = cube root of 512 * cube root of 4 = 8 * cube root of 4, exactly.\n\nSo answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want a decimal approximation: V \u2248 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI want to check: 8 mph with 2 sq ft gives pressure: k=1/256, so pressure= (1/256)*2*8^3= (1/256)*2*512= (1/256)*1024=4. Good.\n\nNow for 4 sq ft: (1/256)*4*V^3=32, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048 = 8 * cube root of 4, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer with explanation. I'll produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer.

This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Solve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 256:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20038192 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Divide both sides by 4:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192 / 4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 512 \u00d7 4 and 512 = 8\u00b3, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(8\u00b3 \u00b7 4) = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}\n\nIf you prefer a decimal approximation, note that \u221b4 is approximately 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph.",

        "critique": "Step 1. Key Concepts and Correct Approach:\n\u2003\u2022 The problem uses a joint variation model where pressure P varies jointly as area A and the cube of velocity V, i.e., P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3 for some constant k.\n\u2003\u2022 First, determine k using the provided values. Then apply the model to determine the unknown velocity.\n\nStep 2. Check of the Student\u2019s Solution:\n\u20031. The student sets up the variation relationship correctly as P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u20032. Substituting P = 4, A = 2, V = 8 gives:\n\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, the student writes:\n\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024, leading to k = 4/1024 = 1/256. (This is correct.)\n\u20033. The student then substitutes P = 32, A = 4 into the model:\n\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003This simplifies as 32 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiplying both sides by 64 yields:\n\u2003\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\u2003\u2192\u20032048 = V\u00b3.\n\u20034. Taking the cube root, the student obtains V = \u221b2048.\n\u2003\u2003Since 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, we can write V = 2^(11/3), which is also expressed as 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 mph (because 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) and 2^(2/3) = \u221b(2\u00b2) = \u221b4). This is exactly what the student concluded.\n\nStep 3.
