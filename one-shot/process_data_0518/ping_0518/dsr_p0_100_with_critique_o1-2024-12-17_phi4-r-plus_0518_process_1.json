            "solution": "We are given problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have the relationship: P = k * A * V^3. Given that when V = 8 mph and A=2, then P = 4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4= k*2*512 = k*1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we need to find V when A=4 and P=32. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor 2048: 2^11 = 2048. So cube root: V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want a decimal approximate? Alternatively, we can simplify: 2^(2/3) is about 2^(0.66667) approx 1.5874. So V approx = 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph, approximately 12.7 mph. But maybe the answer is expressed in radical form: 8 * cube root(4) mph? Let's check: 2^(2/3) = cube root(2^2) = cube root(4). So answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph. Wait, check: 8 * cube root(4) mph. But is that correct? Let's check: (8 cube root 4)^3 = 512 * 4 = 2048, yes.\n\nWait, but we can also do: V = cube root of (32*64) = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nLet's check: 8 cube root of 4 mph is approximately 8*1.5874= 12.699 mph.

When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nLet's denote that P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: P=4, A=2, V=8 mph. Then 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when P=32, A=4. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now cube root of 2048 equals? Factor 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)? Actually 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: V = 8 * cube root of 4? Wait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3+2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But then 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2^2, which is the cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2048 approx 12.7 mph. But let's see if we can simplify: 2048 = 2^11. The cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, which is about 12.7 mph. Alternatively, we can solve exactly: V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, check: Actually 8 mph gives 4 pounds. Then 4 square feet at 12.7 mph gives pressure: P = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3). Let's check approximate: 12.7^3 approx 2048, so P= (4/256)*2048= (1/64)*2048=32. So that's consistent.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is cube root of 2048 mph, which is 8*2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also express it as: V = 8 * (cube root of 4) mph. Let's see: Actually cube root of 4 = 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nWait, let's check: 8*(cube root of 4) is 8*(cube root of 4) mph. But 8 * cube root of 4 is 8*(approx 1.5874) = 12.699 mph.

This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given data:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2.

Find V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) mph\n\nThis is the exact answer.

Given: when V=8, A=2, P=4, so 4 = k*2*(8^3). 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 *512 = k *1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then second scenario: P=32, A=4, unknown velocity V. Then 32 = k *4 * V^3, but k=1/256, so 32= (1/256)*4 * V^3 = (4/256) V^3 = (1/64) V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V= cube root of 2048.

            "solution": "We are given that \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3. We are told that when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So then k = 4/(2*512) = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we want: find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So we have: 32 = k * 4 * V^3, where k=1/256. So equation becomes: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64=2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now solve for V: V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048: 2048=2^11, since 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3). But if we want a decimal, we can compute: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = about 12.7 mph? Wait, let's check: 2^(3)=8, 2^(4)=16, so cube root of 2048 is between 12 and 13. Let's compute: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But maybe we want an exact expression. But perhaps the answer is in radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= (2^(2/3))*2^(3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But then maybe not simpler. Alternatively, 2048= 8*256, so cube root of 2048= cube root of (8*256)= cube root of 8 * cube root of 256= 2 * cube root of 256. But cube root of 256= cube root of (2^8)=2^(8/3). So that equals 2^(11/3) as before.\n\nWe can also find approximate value: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.6667)= about 12.7 mph, but let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 2048. So answer: V = 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, check: Actually 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3) and 2^(2/3)= about 1.5874, so product=8*1.5874= 12.6992 mph approx.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer: The wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer in box.

Then given: when velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. So 4 = k * 2 * (8)^3. 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So we have 32 = k * 4 * V^3, where k = 1/256. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (V^3)/64, so then V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Let's see: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But maybe we want to simplify to radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph, but that's not a nice number. Alternatively, maybe we can compute approximate value: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666) = approx 12.7 mph. But let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 2048? Let's recalc: 12.7^3 is around 12.7^3 = 2048. So answer: V = cube root of 2048, which is exactly 2^(11/3) mph. But perhaps we want to simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. So answer: wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph. That is the exact answer.

Let's check if maybe we can get a simplified radical expression: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so answer becomes: 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want approximate value: 8* (cube root of 4) approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so product is about 12.699, so approximately 12.7 mph. But likely answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 8^3=512, so k=4/1024=1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, then 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32= (4/256) V^3 = (1/64) V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, and V= cube root of 2048. We can factor: 2048=2^11, so V=2^(11/3)=2^3 *2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8* cube root of 4 miles per hour. But wait, check: cube root of 4 is not simplified to a rational number, so answer is in radical form. Alternatively, if we want an approximate value: about 12.7 mph.\n\nLet's check: 12.7 mph, cube velocity: 12.7^3= about 2048, yes.\n\nThus answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph.

This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Solving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify (1/256) \u00b7 4:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3)\n\u2003\u2003This can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\u2003miles per hour.",
