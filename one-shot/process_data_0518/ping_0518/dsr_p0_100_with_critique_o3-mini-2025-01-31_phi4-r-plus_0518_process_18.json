            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P is jointly proportional to the area A and cube of the wind's velocity V. That is, P = k A V^3, where k is constant of proportionality.\n\nGiven: when V=8 mph and A=2, then P=4. So equation: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nThen we are asked: find V when P=32 and A=4. So equation: 32 = k * 4 * V^3 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (V^3)/64. So then multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Now find cube root: V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^11 = 2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But we can also simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we want a decimal approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8*1.5874 = 12.699, approx 12.7 mph. But let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 12.7^3 = 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048? Possibly not exactly. But I'll check: cube root of 2048 exactly equals 2^(11/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approx 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, but let me re-check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048. So cube root of 2048 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3). Let me check approximate: 2^(2/3) ~ 1.5874, so 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph. So answer: about 12.70 mph.\n\nI can also write answer in radical form: 8\u221b4 mph. So answer: The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph (approximately 12.7 mph).\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a neat explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer with \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So P = k * A * V^3 for some constant k.\n\nGiven: When V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4 pounds. So substitute: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so equation: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when A=4, P=32. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4* V^3. Multiply: (1/256)*4 = 4/256 = 1/64. So equation: 32 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3, i.e. 2048 = V^3. Now find cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^11 (2^11=2048). So cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But the answer might be simplified as 2^(11/3) mph, or approximate value? Wait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) which is about 12.7 mph? Let me recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6667) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6667) = 8 * 1.6 = 12.8 mph. But let's do it exactly: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But perhaps the answer expects an answer in mph in simplest radical form: 8 * cube root of 4. Because 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph. But maybe they want a decimal approximation? The question says \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" I can express it as V = cube root of 2048 mph, which equals 2^(11/3) mph. But perhaps simpler is: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: 8 cube root of 4 = 8*(cube root of 4). Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256)= 2 cube root of 256? Wait, let's recalc: 2048= 8*256? Actually, 8*256=2048. Then cube root of (8*256)= cube root of 8 * cube root of 256=2* cube root of 256. But cube root of 256= 256^(1/3)= 2^(8/3)= 2^(2.6667)? That is not simpler. Let's see: 2^(11/3) is simplest.\n\nWait, I'll check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.66667)= 2^3 * 2^(0.66667)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8 cube root of (2^2)= 8 cube root of 4. That is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute approximate: 8 cube root of 4 \u2248 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699.

Use k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003Now, when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we have:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the constant:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64.\n\u2003\u2003So, 32 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048, so V\u00b3 = 2048.\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So mathematically: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when velocity is 8 mph and area is 2 square feet, pressure is 4 pounds. Then compute constant k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Next, find V when area is 4 square feet and pressure is 32 pounds. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Then find V: cube root of 2048. Let's check: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^10 = 1024, 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)? Wait, 11/3 = 3 + 2/3, so equals 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8* cube root of 2^2 = 8* cube root of 4. But maybe we can simplify: cube root of 2048 is 12.7? Wait, let's check: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so 12.7 is approximate. But maybe we want an exact expression in terms of radicals: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= (2^(1/3))^11, but that's not simpler. Wait, let me re-check: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3). That is the exact expression. Alternatively, maybe we can write it as 2^(11/3)= (2^(3+2/3))=8*2^(2/3)=8* cube root of 4. But typically answer in radical form: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want a decimal approximations: 8 * cube root of 4, cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so equals about 12.699 mph. But the problem probably expects answer as \"8* cube root of 4 mph\" or \"2^(11/3)\" mph.\n\nLet's check: The pressure P = (1/256)*A*V^3. For A=4, P=32, then V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (8192)/4 = 2048, as computed. So V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.6666) is around 12.7 mph. But wait, is that consistent with the given units? The original velocity is in mph, so yes.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or equivalently, cube root of 2048 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3)=8* cube root of 4. So answer is V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut maybe we can simplify: 2^(2/3) = (cube root of 4). So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nDouble-check: If V=8 cube root of 4 mph, then V^3 = (8 cube root of 4)^3 = 512 * 4 = 2048, then pressure P = (1/256)*4*2048 = (1/256)*8192 = 32, correct.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI can present the answer as: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a neat format: \nGiven that P = k A V^3, from the first condition: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3)= k*2*512=1024k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then using second condition: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3)=8* cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with explanation.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" This means: P = k A V^3, where k is a constant.\n\nWe are given: when V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, then P=4 lbs. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So then: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then we are asked: find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So we have: 32 = k * 4 * V^3, where k=1/256. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now we compute cube root of 2048. Let's factor: 2048=2^? 2^11 = 2048? Actually 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we want to express as radical form. Alternatively, we can check: 8^3=512, 10^3=1000, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so not integer. Alternatively, note that 2048=2^11. Then V = 2^(11/3). That is the answer. But maybe we want decimal approximations: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666)=8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, so product is about 12.699. Alternatively, we can compute: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8^3 * 2^2) = 8 * cube root of 4, as above. But the problem likely expects an answer in simplest radical form: V = 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, check: The problem said: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph. But is that the simplest form? Alternatively, we can express answer as: 2^(11/3) mph. Let me check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8\u221b(2^2)=8\u221b4 mph. So answer: 8\u221b4 mph. Alternatively, we can also simplify: cube root of 4 is not further simplified. So answer: 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, is that the answer? Let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph approximates to 8 * 1.5874=12.699 mph approx.\n\nI can double-check: k=1/256, so P= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so 32= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3= 32*64=2048, then V= cube root of 2048. 2048=8*256=8*256=8*256? Wait, let me recalc: 32*64= 2048. 2^11=2048, so V=2^(11/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8\u221b4 mph. So answer is correct.\n\nThus final answer: wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.

Then for P=32 and A=4, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, and V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3)=8\u221b4 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce final answer with explanation. We'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

Find k using the given information:\n\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, the pressure P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003Substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = 1024k\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity for the new conditions:\n\u2003Now, when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation is:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003We have V\u00b3 = 2048. Notice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u00b2\u00b9\u00b9\u221a\u00b3 = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221b(2\u00b2) = 8\u221b4\n\nSo the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}",

Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, and P=4 pounds. So 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3=512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then the formula: P = (1/256)* A * V^3.\n\nWe are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So we plug in: 32 = (1/256)* 4 * V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4 * V^3. 32*256 = 8192. Then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. Now find cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But probably they want a numerical answer. Alternatively, check: 2^(11/3)=? Let's compute approximate value: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^0.6666 = 8 * 2^(2/3) approximately 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But perhaps they want answer in radical form: 8 * cube root(4)? Actually, wait: 2^(2/3) = cube root of (2^2)= cube root of 4. So answer = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But we can simplify further: cube root of 4 is not a rational number. Alternatively, we can express as cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph. Alternatively, we can also note that 2048=8^3? Let's check: 8^3=512, no. 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197. So no integer cube.\n\nWait, check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * (cube root of 4) \u2248 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph. But the question might be expecting an exact answer in terms of radicals, i.e., V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut we can simplify further: cube root of 4 = cube root of (2^2). So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nLet's check: 4 square feet, 32 pounds, then equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. And cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3).

Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) mph\n\nAlternatively, you can express 2^(2/3) as \u221b(4), so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b(4) mph\n\nThis is the exact answer. For an approximate value, note that \u221b(4) \u2248 1.5874, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

        "critique": "Step 1. Key Concepts & Correct Approach:\n\u2022 We are given that pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the velocity V. The relation is P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Find the constant k using the provided condition (P, A, V).\n\u2022 Use the established formula to solve for V under the new conditions.\n\nStep 2. Check of Each Step in the Student\u2019s Solution:\n1. The student correctly set up the equation as P = k\u00b7A\u00b7V\u00b3.\n2. They substituted P = 4, A = 2, V = 8 into the equation:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3, with 8\u00b3 = 512, so\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024,\n\u2003\u2003leading to k = 4/1024 = 1/256. (Correct)\n3. Using the constant k, they set up the equation for the new condition:\n\u2003\u2003P = 32, A = 4, so:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n4. Multiplying both sides by 256 gives:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3,\n\u2003\u2003which simplifies to:\n\u2003\u20038192 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3 and then V\u00b3 = 8192/4 = 2048. (Correct)\n5. Finally, they find V by computing the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2048).\n\u2003\u2003Noting that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, they correctly express:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 8\u00b72^(2/3) = 8\u00b7\u221b(4) mph.\n\u2003\u2003This gives an exact answer, and its numerical approximation is about 12.7 mph.
