            "solution": "We are given: The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. That is: P = k A V^3, where k is constant. We are told: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, and P = 4. So we can solve for k: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512. So k = 4 / (2 * 512) = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. Now we are asked: find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. That is: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, i.e. 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. So then V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. Solve for V: V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, but check: 2^11 = 2048. But cube root of 2^11 equals 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can compute: 2048 is not a perfect cube. Alternatively, maybe we can solve: 32 = (1/64)*V^3 implies V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Alternatively, we can compute: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8 * 256) = cube root of 8 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of 256. But cube root of 256 is not an integer. Let's try: 6^3 = 216, 7^3 = 343, so it's between 6 and 7. Wait: 2048 is not between 216 and 343. Wait, recalc: 2^11 = 2048, then cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) ~ 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 1.6 = 12.8 approx. But check: 2^(0.6666) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4, which is about 1.5874. So then 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699. So V is approximately 12.7 mph. But let me recalc exactly: V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express it as 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, so answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph. But I can also check: 8\u221b4 approximates to 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, but maybe I can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = (2^3 * 2^(2/3)) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can write answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nLet's double-check: P = (1/256)*A*V^3. For A=4, V=2^(11/3), then P = (1/256)*4*(2^(11)) = (4/256)*2^(11) = (1/64)*2048 = 32. So correct.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}. But then I'll show the reasoning steps.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, we have\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, this becomes\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are given that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we need to find V. Substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}",

That is, P = k A V^3, where k is constant of proportionality.\n\nGiven: When velocity is 8 mph, area is 2 ft^2, pressure is 4 pounds. So plug: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow given: find wind velocity when pressure is 32 pounds on 4 ft^2 sail. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Simplify: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's simplify: 2048=2^11, so cube root of 2^11=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we want a decimal? Actually, maybe we want an exact answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 4 approx= 1.5874, times 8 = 12.699, so approx 12.7 mph. But wait, let me check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = 2^3.6666 approx = 12.7 mph.\n\nWait but maybe the answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But is that simplified? Alternatively, we can write as cube root of 2048 mph, but that's not simpler.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can approximate to 12.7 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a simpler form: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, but we want answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, but let's check: 8*(cube root of 4) mph approx equals 8*1.5874= 12.699 mph, which is consistent with our computed value.\n\nWait, but maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 4 is the same as 4^(1/3). So answer: V = 8*4^(1/3) mph.\n\nI want to check if there's any other possibility: P = k A V^3, so V = (P/(kA))^(1/3). Given k = 1/256, so V = (P*256/A)^(1/3). With P=32, A=4, then V = (32*256/4)^(1/3)= (32*64)^(1/3)= (2048)^(1/3)= 2048^(1/3)= 2^(11/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.

Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048, so V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3.

Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Let's denote the constant k such that P = k A V^3. Then plug in known values: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, then k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find velocity when P = 32 and A=4. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4* V^3. Simplify: 32 = (4/256) V^3 = (1/64) V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 as 2^? Let's see: 2^11 = 2048. So V^3 = 2^11, then V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8*2^(2/3) = 8*(cube root of 4). But we can also express it as 2^(11/3). Alternatively, check: if V = 8 mph, then cube of 8 is 512, but then 4/256 * 512 = 4*2 = 8, no. Let's recalc carefully: P = k A V^3. k = 1/256. For new values: P=32, A=4, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Yes. So cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). That is not a nice integer. But maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe the answer is expressed as a radical: 8\u221b4 mph. Alternatively, we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But is that the simplest answer?

Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, we can check: 8 mph is the known speed for the given data. But then our new velocity is bigger. Let's check approximate value: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8 * 1.5874 \u2248 12.699, so velocity is about 12.7 mph.

Yes.\n\nLet's check: 8 mph: 8^3 = 512, times 2 gives 1024, times 1/256 gives 4. Yes.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, or exactly 2^(11/3) mph. But let me check: 2^(11/3) mph. But if I want to simplify further: 2^(11/3) mph = (2^(1/3))^11 mph. Not simpler.\n\nAlternatively, we can write: V = (2048)^(1/3). 2048^(1/3) = (2^11)^(1/3) = 2^(11/3) mph. That is the answer.\n\nThus answer: 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, check: 8\u221b4 mph is the same as 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph. But let me check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4, so yes.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph. But can we simplify that further? Possibly we can express it as 2^(11/3) mph. I'll answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nWait, but wait: The problem statement said \"wind's velocity\" and \"miles per hour\", so the answer is in mph. But then the answer is not an integer mph. So answer: wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph or 8\u221b4 mph. But let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66667) which is indeed approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also check: cube root of 2048, if I compute: 12.7^3 = 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048. So yes.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is (2048)^(1/3) mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI can express the answer as: V = cube root of 2048 mph = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll then produce final answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nWait, let me check: 8\u221a[3]4 mph is the same as 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, that's not exactly 2^(11/3)? Because 8\u221b4 = 8 * 4^(1/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 2^(3+2/3) = 2^(11/3). Yes.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given data:\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, the pressure P = 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the value of k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nSubstitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nSo:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate value, note that \u221b4 \u2248 1.5874, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So the relation: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: When V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So substitute: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So then k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds: P=32, A=4, unknown velocity V. Use formula: 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32 * 64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Now compute: 2048=2^11? Let's check: 2^11=2048 indeed. But 2^11 = 2048. But we want cube root: cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). But the problem likely expects a simpler answer if it is exact? Actually check: 2^(11/3) is not an integer. Let's check: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, so it's not integer. Wait maybe I've done arithmetic incorrectly: Let's re-check: 8^3=512, so 2 * 512 = 1024, yes. So k=4/1024=1/256. Then new equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)* V^3= (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64=2048 = V^3. Cube root of 2048 is not an integer: 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 is about 2048? Actually, let me compute: 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7. But I'd like to express in radical form: V= cube root of 2048. Factor 2048= 2^11. So cube root of 2^11=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). That is the answer. But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V=8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, V= 8*(4)^(1/3). But can we simplify further? 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, so 8*1.5874=12.699. So V approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, but let me re-read the problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So the relationship is P = k A V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So k= 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for A=4, P=32, find V: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3= 32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048. Now factor 2048= 2^11, so V= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3)= 8*(cube root of 4). So answer: 8*(cube root of 4) mph. That is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if we want a decimal: V approx 12.7 mph. Let me check: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7=161.29, times 12.7= 2048. So yes.\n\nThus final answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus I'll answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll provide answer in the final answer box.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.

Then we are given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4 pounds. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find V when A=4 and P=32: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want approximate decimal. Wait, let's see: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, which is approx 1.5874, so V = 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph, which is approx 12.70 mph. But we can also express as cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe the answer is expected to be expressed as the cube root of 2048 or 8\u221b(4) mph. But wait, let's check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can also compute: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) ~ 12.7 mph. But wait, is that correct? Let's check: 8 mph cubed is 512, times constant factor k=1/256, times A=2 gives 4. Yes. For the new scenario: A=4, P=32, so equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph, which is approx 12.7 mph. So answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph, which is about 12.7 mph. But wait, is that correct? Let's double-check: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Actually, 12.7^3 = 12.7^3 approximates to 2048. But let me check: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 12.7*12.7=161.29, times 12.7 is 2048.383, so it's correct.\n\nI want to check if we can simplify further: 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) mph = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3).

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have P = k A V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4 pounds. So we solve for k: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so then 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then the formula is P = (A V^3)/256.\n\nThen question: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So use P=32, A=4, then 32 = (4 V^3)/256, so multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 V^3, so V^3 = (32 * 256)/4 = (32 * 256)/4 = 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then we take cube root: cube root of 2048. We know 2048 = 2^11, since 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)? Actually 11/3 = 3.6666, so that equals 2^(3+2/3) = 8 * cube root of 2^2 = 8 * cube root of 4. But that's not a nice integer. Let's check: V = cube root(2048) = 12.7? Wait, let me re-check: 12.7^3 = 12.7^3 approximate 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 2048? Possibly it's exactly 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 approximates: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 2048? Let me check: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7. Actually, let's compute: 12.7^3 = (approx) 2048.383? Let me check: Actually, 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 12.7 * 161.29 = 2047.583? Actually, let me compute exactly: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7. Actually, I can do: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). But 2^(2/3) is not a nice integer. Let me re-check: maybe I made a mistake: given P = k A V^3, and k=1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32 = (4 V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 V^3, then V^3 = (32*256)/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so yes. So V = cube root of 2048. And 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3). That is the exact answer in terms of exponents. But maybe we want a decimal approximation. Alternatively, we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= (2^(3) * 2^(2/3))= 8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, so answer is 8* cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we want a decimal approximation. Alternatively, maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3)= (2^(3) * 2^(2/3))= 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nHowever, let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3.6666 = 12.7 approximately. Let me compute: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, times 8 equals 12.6992 mph approximately.\n\nSo answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, but let me re-read the problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So formula: P = k A V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4. So k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32 = (1/256)*4 V^3, so 32 = (4 V^3)/256, so multiply both sides by 256: 32*256=4 V^3, so V^3= (32*256)/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3) mph, which is exactly 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll provide final answer in a neat box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph} \\text{ (approximately 12.7 mph)}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer. We'll produce answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. We'll produce answer as: \"8 * cube root of 4 mph\" or \"approximately 12.7 mph\".\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph} \\approx 12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a neat box.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means that\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nSubstitute k, A, and P into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 256 to clear the fraction:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 256:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\n\u2003\u20038192 / 4 = V\u00b3  \n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nIf you wish to approximate this value:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u221b4 \u2248 1.5874  \n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.6992 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph} \\quad\\text{(approximately 12.7 mph)}}",
