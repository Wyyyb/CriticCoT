            "solution": "We are given the problem statement: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" We'll denote relationship: P = k * A * V^3. Then using given initial conditions: when V=8, A=2, P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then for new condition: P=32, A=4, V unknown. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)? Let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 2048 = approximately 12.7 mph? Wait, let's check: 12.7^3 = 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 approximates: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = (12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7 = 2048.383) so it's about 12.7 mph. But let's check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, which is about 1.5874, times 8 gives about 12.7 mph. So answer: wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, or cube root of 2048 mph, or about 12.7 mph.\n\nLet's check consistency: P = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3) approximately equals (4/256)*12.7^3 = (1/64)*12.7^3, and 12.7^3 approximates 2048, so equals 2048/64 = 32 pounds. So answer is correct.\n\nThus final answer: V = cube root of 2048, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in boxed answer: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ miles per hour}}.\n\nBut I'll check if the answer is exactly: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Let's see: 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, so answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph. But then 8 cube root of 4 = 8 * cube root of 4, which is exactly the same as 2^(3) * 2^(2/3) = 2^(11/3) mph. But the simplest form: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. But maybe I'll give the approximate answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ miles per hour (approximately)}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer as \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer in final answer message.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = 1024k\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003We are given P = 32 pounds and A = 4 ft\u00b2. Substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThus, the exact wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) mph\n\nFor an approximate value, note that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, which is approximately 1.5874. Therefore:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{12.7 \\text{ miles per hour (approximately)}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nWe are given: When velocity is 8 mph, pressure is 4 pounds on a sail of 2 square feet. So, we plug: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So, equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve: Multiply: (1/256)*4 = 4/256 = 1/64. So equation becomes: 32 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Now find cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11 = 2048. But cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) which is not a nice integer. Wait maybe I need to check: Actually, 8 mph times 8 mph times 8 mph? Let's check: 8 mph gives 8^3=512, so pressure= (1/256)*2*512= (1/256)*1024 = 4. That works. For new problem: Pressure = 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048. Cube root of 2048 =? Let's compute: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so it's between 12 and 13. Alternatively, factor 2048= 2^11, so cube root= 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666)=8*2^(2/3). 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so product approx 8*1.5874= 12.699. So answer approximately 12.70 mph. But let me check: Actually, maybe the answer is exactly 8*(2^(2/3)) mph. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer in terms of radicals. But since 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8*(cube root of 4) mph. But wait, check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of (2^2)= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8*cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: 8*cube root of 4 = 8* cube root of 4 mph, which is the answer. Alternatively, if we want approximate, 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, let's check: We have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 2048, and cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. But maybe we want the answer as 8* cube root of 4 mph, or maybe simplified as 2^(11/3). Let's see: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8*cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut let me check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut wait, 8*(cube root of 4) is not 12.7 mph? Let's compute: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, multiplied by 8 equals 12.6992 mph approx. So answer: Approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also represent answer in terms of radical: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer step by step.\n\nStep 1: Write equation: P = k * A * V^3.\nStep 2: Use given: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3, so solve for k.\n8^3=512, so 4 = k*2*512 = 1024k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\nStep 3: For new problem: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4=32*64=2048.\nStep 4: V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4 mph.\nStep 5: Answer: V=8 cube root of 4 mph approx 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in boxed answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant factor:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate numerical value:\n\u2003\u2003\u221b4 \u2248 1.5874, so V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}",

So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow second scenario: Pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds, with unknown velocity V. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's see: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11 = 2048. So V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we want a decimal approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approximately. But maybe we want an exact answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph. Alternatively, we can say V = 8 * (4^(1/3)) mph. But wait, let's check: 4^3 = 64, no, 4^(1/3) is the cube root of 4, not 2^(2/3). Let's re-check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2^2 = 4^(1/3)? Actually, wait: 2^(2/3) = (2^2)^(1/3) = 4^(1/3). So yes, it's same.\n\nSo answer: The wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph or about 12.70 mph. Let me check: 8^3 = 512, times 2 gives 1024, times constant 1/256 equals 4. Yes.\n\nWait check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, then V^3 = 32 * 256 / 4 = 32 * 64 = 2048, so cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph. So answer: Approximately 12.7 mph. We can also express answer as 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. That is the exact answer.\n\nWe can also simplify: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI can now produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.

Use the constant k to find the unknown wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the right side:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64, so:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So relation: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, P = 4. So then: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So then: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then question: find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. So use: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3, so 8192 = 4*V^3. So V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we want a numeric answer. Alternatively, we can compute cube root of 2048: cube root of 2048 is about? Let's see: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197. So it's between 12 and 13. But can we simplify? Actually, 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But the answer in exact form is 8 * cube root of 4? Wait, 2^(2/3) = cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But if we want approximate value, then cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so V approx = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph, which is about 12.7 mph. Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph. But let's check: 12.7^3 is about 2048. So answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can check: P = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3). 12.7^3 approx equals 2048, then P approx equals (1/256)*4*2048 = (1/256)*8192 = 32. So answer is consistent.\n\nI can also see if there's a simpler answer: The equation becomes: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI can also check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph. But let me double-check: Actually 2^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, so 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box with explanation.

When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Let's denote the constant of variation as k. Then we have: P = k * A * V^3. Given that when A=2, V=8, P=4, then 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024k, then k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then for second scenario: P=32, A=4, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve: 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor 2048: 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But that is not a nice number. Wait check: Actually 2^11 = 2048. But perhaps we can simplify: V = cube root(2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: 2^(2/3) = approximately 2^(0.6667) approx 1.5874, so V approx = 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But maybe the problem expects an answer in terms of radicals or fractional exponents. Wait check: We have P = k A V^3. Then k = 1/256. So P = (A V^3)/256. For the second scenario, 32 = (4 V^3)/256, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (8192)/4 = 2048, so V = cube root(2048) = 2^(11/3). That is the answer. Possibly can be simplified further: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can express 2^(2/3) as the cube root of 4. Because cube root of 4 is 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait check: 2^(11/3) = (2^3)*(2^(2/3)) = 8*(2^(2/3)). And 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph. But wait check: Actually 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) which is about 12.7 mph. Let me check: 8 * cube root of 4, cube root of 4 is about 1.587, so 8*1.587=12.696, so yes.\n\nThus answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph or V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait maybe we can simplify: Actually, let me re-check: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k*1024, so k= 4/1024 = 1/256. So then second: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. And 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3). So answer: 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWe can also express as cube root of 2048 mph. So answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph. But the simplest form is 2^(11/3) mph. But then maybe they want a numerical value? Possibly answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThe problem: \"Find the wind velocity\" likely expects answer in mph. So answer: about 12.7 mph. But wait, check: 8 mph gave pressure 4 pounds, and now with bigger area and bigger pressure, the wind velocity is larger than 8 mph. But our computed value is 12.7 mph, which is plausible.\n\nWait, let me re-check: With area 2, velocity 8 mph, pressure is 4. With area 4, velocity 12.7 mph, pressure is 32. So the ratio: Pressure is proportional to area times cube of velocity. So doubling area quadruples pressure if velocity constant, but here pressure increased by factor 8 (from 4 to 32) so that is 2^3, so velocity increased by factor 2, so velocity should be 16 mph if area doubled and pressure increased by factor 8. But wait, check: Actually, if you double area, then pressure doubles if velocity is constant. But here pressure increased by factor 8, so that is 2 times more than doubling area. Wait, let me recalc: For area 2, velocity 8 mph, pressure= 4. For area 4, if velocity were 8 mph, then pressure would be 8 (because doubling area doubles pressure). But we need 32, which is 4 times more than 8, so velocity must be increased by factor cube root of 4, which is about 1.587. So then velocity becomes 8*1.587=12.7 mph. That matches our calculation.\n\nWait, I want to double-check: If A=4, then pressure = k * 4 * V^3, and we want that to equal 32. We know k=1/256, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, V = cube root of 2048, which is approximately 12.7 mph. Yes.\n\nThus answer: 2^(11/3) mph or 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, in decimal approximate: 12.7 mph.\n\nI can now produce final answer. I'll produce final answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3}\\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.

Substituting the given values: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3).

Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) mph\u2003\u2003or\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nIf you need a decimal approximation:\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) \u2248 1.587, so V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\nFinal Answer:\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{11/3}\\text{ mph}}",
