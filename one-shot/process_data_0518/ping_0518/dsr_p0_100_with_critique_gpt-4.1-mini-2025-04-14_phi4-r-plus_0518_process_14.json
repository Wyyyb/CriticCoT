            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V = 8 mph, A=2, then P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now find wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. So 32 = k * 4 * V^3, with k = 1/256. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048? Let's check: 32 * 64 = (32*60) + (32*4) = 1920 + 128 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048, so V = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8*(2^(2/3)). But we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) = (cube root of 4) maybe. But then maybe we can simplify: V = 2^(11/3). But is that the answer? Let me check: Alternatively, note that 2048 is 8^3? Actually 8^3=512, so no. Let's check: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096. So no integer. Alternatively, factor: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But then we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But that is the answer in terms of radicals: 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we can simplify: Let V = cube root of 2048. Let's see if it's a nice number: cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is not an integer. Alternatively, we can express as approximately: 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so V approximates 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph, approximately 12.7 mph. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, maybe we can simplify: 2^(2/3) = cube root of (2^2) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nHowever, let's check if we can simplify further: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nLet's check: Pressure = (1/256)*A*V^3. For A=4, V=8 cube root of 4, then V^3 = (8 cube root of 4)^3 = 8^3 * 4 = 512*4 = 2048, then P = (1/256)*4*2048 = (4*2048)/256 = 8192/256 = 32, correct.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut wait, maybe we can simplify further: 8 cube root of 4 = cube root of (8^3 * 4) = cube root of (512*4) = cube root of 2048, which is the same as before.\n\nWe can also write answer as: V = 2^(11/3) mph, or V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI want to check: 8^3=512, times 4 equals 2048, cube root equals 2^(11/3). So answer is: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nLet's check: Alternatively, we can compute: cube root of 2048 is 12.7 mph approx.\n\nThus answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce final answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}. We'll produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer in text: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph. We'll produce final answer. We'll produce final answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant of proportionality (k).\n\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = 1024k\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds.\n\nSubstitute k = 1/256, A = 4, and P = 32 into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply (1/256) by 4:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nNow, solve for V\u00b3 by multiplying both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Find V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}",

When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Let me re-read the question: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" We need to find V. Let's denote constant k: P = k A V^3. Given that when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4, so 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 =512, so 2*512 =1024, so 4 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So k=1/256.\n\nNow new condition: A=4, P=32, and unknown V, so equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Now compute cube root of 2048. Let's see: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, so it's between 8 and 16. But perhaps note that 2048=2^11, so cube root equals 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3)? Wait, let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3) which is not an integer. But maybe I can find an integer? Let's check: 2048 = 8^3 is 512, no; 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so no integer. But maybe we can simplify: V^3=2048, so V = cube root of 2048. But perhaps the intended answer is V= 8\u221a[3]{2}? Wait, let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can factor out a cube: 2048= 8*256, but 256 is 4^4, not a perfect cube. Let's factor prime factors: 2048= 2^11, so cube root =2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can express as 8 * cube root of 4? Actually, 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph. But that is not a nice number. Let me check: maybe I miscomputed: Given P= k A V^3, so from the initial condition: 4= k *2*512, so k= 4/(1024)=1/256. Then for new condition: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3= (32*256)/4=32*64=2048, yes.\n\nMaybe the answer is expected in radical form: V= \u221b2048 = \u221b(2^11)=2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8 *2^(2/3)= 8 * \u221b(4). That is the answer. But is that correct? Let's check: 8 * \u221b4 approximately equals 8 * 1.5874=12.699, so velocity is about 12.7 mph. But let me re-read the problem: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" It might be that we are allowed to get a decimal approximation. But maybe the answer is expressed as a radical. Let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3)*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8\u221b(4). Alternatively, we can express as 4\u221b(32) or something else? Let's check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, yes.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake: Let's try to simplify: V^3=2048= 2^11, then V= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: V=8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can also write V= 4\u221b(32) but that's not simpler.\n\nLet's check: 2^(11/3)= (2^3 *2^(2/3))=8*2^(2/3)=8* cube root of 4. So answer: V=8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also check: (8 cube root of 4)^3=8^3*(cube root of 4)^3=512*4=2048. Yes.\n\nThus answer: V=8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also check if maybe I misread the problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P= k A V^3. So initial condition: P=4, A=2, V=8, so k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. So then for new condition: A=4, P=32, so 32= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, then V^3=32*64=2048, then V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8 cube root of 4 mph. So answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nI can also express it as: V= 8\u221b4 mph. I can also approximate: \u221b4 is about 1.5874, so V is about 12.699 mph. But the problem likely expects an exact answer: V= 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nThus I'll answer: The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, or equivalently, 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}}. We'll check if the problem expects mph. Yes.\n\nI'll now produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph. We'll produce answer in final answer box.

So we can solve for k:\n4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow second scenario: P=32 pounds, A=4 square feet, find V such that: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we can also simplify: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we want a decimal approximate value. Let's see: cube root of 4 approx equals 1.5874, so product equals 8*1.5874=12.699. Alternatively, we can express answer exactly as 8\u221b4 mph. However, maybe we can simplify further: Actually, 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666). But it's not a nice rational number. Alternatively, maybe we can simplify: Actually, we can express in radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But is that simpler? Possibly not. Alternatively, we can say: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, but let me check: 8*4^(1/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express as: V = (2048)^(1/3). That might be acceptable.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility to simplify? 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI can also compute approximate value: 2^(2/3) approx 1.5874, so V approx 12.699 mph, approx 12.7 mph.\n\nI can check: if V=12.7 mph, then V^3=12.7^3 approx 2048, and then pressure P = (1/256)*4*(2048) = (4*2048)/256=8192/256=32, so correct.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph, or exactly 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in final answer message.

Find the constant k using the initial conditions:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\u2003\u20038\u00b3 = 512, so:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Thus, k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when:\n\u2003\u2003A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the right side:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given: Pressure P is proportional to area A and cube of wind velocity V. i.e. P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4. So k = P / (A * V^3) = 4/(2*512) = 4/(1024) = 1/256. Wait, check: 2 * (8^3) = 2*512 = 1024, so k=4/1024 = 1/256. Then new: P=32, A=4, find V such that 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Then V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Wait, check: 32*64=2048, then V= cube root of 2048. But note: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096. 2048 is exactly 2^11? Actually, 2^11=2048, but cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3)? Let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further? Alternatively, we can express answer as V = cube root of 2048. But let me check: Actually, maybe we can simplify: 32= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3= 32*64=2048, V= cube root of 2048. But 2048= 2^11, so V=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can express it as 8* cube root of 4? Wait, 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2= cube root of 4, so V= 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But the problem might require a decimal approximation? But likely we can leave as radical form. Alternatively, we can compute approximate: cube root of 2048 = approximate? Let's see: 12.7^3=2048? Let's check: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7*12.7= 12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7= 2048.383, so approximate V=12.7 mph. Wait, check: 12.7 mph, but then 12.7 mph is the wind velocity. But wait, check: 12.7 mph is approximate. But let me check: Actually, 12.7 mph is not exactly 2^(11/3)? Let's check: 2^(11/3) = exp((11/3)*ln2)= exp(3.6667 * 0.6931)= exp(2.543)= 12.71 mph. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut let me recast: Pressure P = k A V^3, and given: 4 = k*2*512, so k=4/1024= 1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, so 32= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048. That is answer.\n\nWe can simplify cube root of 2048: 2048= 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8 * cube root of 4 mph.

So we have: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11 (since 2^11=2048). So cube root of 2^11 equals 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*(2^(2/3)). So answer: wind velocity = 8 * cube root of 4, but simpler: V = 8 * (2^(2/3)) mph, but we can also approximate.

Checking each step of the student's solution:\n\n- **Step 1: Write the formula**\n  \\[\n  P = k \\cdot A \\cdot V^3\n  \\]\n  Correct.\n\n- **Step 2: Find \\( k \\) using given values**\n  \\[\n  4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024k \\implies k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256}\n  \\]\n  Correct.\n\n- **Step 3: Use \\( k \\) to find \\( V \\) when \\( P=32 \\) and \\( A=4 \\)**\n  \\[\n  32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 = \\frac{4}{256} V^3 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3\n  \\]\n  Multiply both sides by 64:\n  \\[\n  32 \\times 64 = V^3 \\implies 2048 = V^3\n  \\]\n  Correct.\n\n- **Step 4: Solve for \\( V \\)**\n  \\[\n  V = \\sqrt[3]{2048}\n  \\]\n  Since \\( 2048 = 2^{11} \\), then\n  \\[\n  V = \\sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^{\\frac{11}{3}} = 2^{3 + \\frac{2}{3}} = 2^3 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 8 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}}\n  \\]\n  Correct.\n\n- **Step 5: Approximate \\( V \\)**\n  \\[\n  2^{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\sqrt[3]{2^2} = \\sqrt[3]{4} \\approx 1.5874\n  \\]\n  So,\n  \\[\n  V \\approx 8 \\times 1.5874 = 12.699 \\approx 12.70 \\text{ mph}\n  \\]\n  Correct.\n\n- **Step 6: Final answer boxed**\n  The student gave:\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{8 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\text{ mph}} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\boxed{12.70 \\text{ mph}}\n  \\]\n  Both are acceptable exact and approximate forms.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Conclusion:\n\n- The student correctly identified the formula.\n- Correctly found the constant of proportionality.\n- Correctly substituted values and solved for \\( V \\).\n- Correctly simplified the cube root expression.\n- Provided both exact and approximate answers.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{V = 8 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\text{ mph} \\approx 12.70 \\text{ mph}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion: right [END]**",
