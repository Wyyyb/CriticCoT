            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. We are given: when velocity is 8 mph, area is 2 sq ft, pressure is 4 pounds. So plug: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so equation becomes: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. Then we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So plug: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So compute: 4/256 = 1/64, so equation becomes: 32 = (1/64)* V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want a decimal approximation. Alternatively, maybe the answer is in radical form: V = 8 * (2^(2/3)) mph, but that is messy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an integer value if we simplify: Let's re-check: Actually, maybe we can simplify: 32 = (1/64)* V^3, then V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, which is not a perfect cube. Wait, is it possible that I misread? Let's check: \"when the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure is 4 pounds\", so constant k = 4/(2*(8^3)) = 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then when area=4 and pressure=32, then equation becomes: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, express as 8 * cube root of 4. Because 2^(2/3) = cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want to simplify further: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so V ~ 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699, roughly 12.7 mph. But likely they want an exact expression: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, let me check: Actually, check: 8^3=512, so if velocity is 8 mph, then pressure on 2 sq ft is 1/256 *2*512 = 4, so that's consistent. So answer: wind velocity = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects a simpler answer. Let me check: \"varies jointly as area and cube of velocity\", so formula: P = k A V^3. Then k = P/(A V^3). For given values: k = 4/(2*8^3)= 4/(2*512)= 4/1024=1/256. Then for new values: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) no, wait, 8*256=2048, so cube root of 2048= cube root of (8*256)= 2* cube root of 256, but 256= 4^4? Actually, 256= 2^8, so cube root of 2^8=2^(8/3)= 2^(2+2/3)=4*2^(2/3). Then times 2 gives 2*4*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). Yes. So answer: 8*2^(2/3) mph or 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if they want a decimal: approx. 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer in a neat form: Let V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is final answer.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation: step-by-step.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in text.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003We are given that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb, we need to find V. Substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant term:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2\u00b2, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\n\nIf a decimal approximation is needed, note that \u221b4 is approximately 1.5874, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph.",

            "solution": "We are given the problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe need to determine the constant of variation and then solve for V.\n\nGiven: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, then P = 4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So k = 1/256.\n\nNow we have: P = (1/256)*A*V^3. Then, for A = 4, P = 32, so 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4 * V^3. 32*256 = 8192. So 8192 = 4 V^3, so V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048, and V = cube root of 2048.\n\nWe need to compute cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^11 because 2^11 = 2048. Then cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = 2 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of (2^8) = 2 * 2^(8/3) = 2^(1+8/3) = 2^(11/3). Not simpler.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But the problem likely expects a simplified radical expression or a decimal. But maybe we can simplify: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But that doesn't look like a nice number. Wait, check: 2^(11/3) is not equal to 8 * cube root of 4? Let's recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4. So answer is: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But can we simplify further? Possibly not.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 4 ~ 1.5874, then multiplied by 8 gives ~12.699 mph. But maybe the answer should be expressed exactly as 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = cube root of 2^11 = cube root of 2048. Alternatively, 2048^(1/3) = 12.7 mph approx.\n\nBut let me check: Actually, maybe I made a mistake: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for 4 square feet and 32 pounds: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). Yes, that is correct.\n\nWe can also express that as 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3+2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut maybe we can also write as 4^(1/3) * 8? Wait, check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4, so yes.\n\nI can express answer as: V = 8 * \u221b4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThus final answer: wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph (exact value) or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a boxed expression.\n\nI'll produce: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}} mph or \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph.\n\nI'll produce: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer accordingly.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003So, 4 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = 1024k\n\u2003\u2003Solving for k:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Now, 32 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 256:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Calculate 32 \u00d7 256:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20038192 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Divide both sides by 4:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192/4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048.\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\u2003\u2003We can also write this as:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) = \u221b(2\u00b2) = \u221b4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is exactly 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 miles per hour, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}",

When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" \n\nGiven: P \u221d A * V^3. So we have: P = k A V^3. Given: when V=8, A=2, P=4. Then we find k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, then k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then new condition: P=32, A=4, find V such that 32 = (1/256)* 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^11, so cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, but maybe can simplify further: approximate value: cube root of 4 ~ 1.5874, so V ~ 12.6992 mph, but we might leave answer in exact form. Alternatively, if we want to express it as 2^(11/3) mph. However, the problem expects a simplified exact answer.\n\nBut wait, check: 2048 = 2^11, cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3) = 8*(cube root of 4). That is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to compute approximate value: V \u2248 12.7 mph.\n\nLet's check: 8 mph originally gives P=4, with area 2, so k=1/256. Then for A=4, V^3 = 2048, V = cube root of 2048. So answer is cube root of 2048 mph. We can also express that as 8 cube root of 4 mph, which is the same. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. \n\nWait, let me re-check: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k=4/1024 = 1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32= (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, then multiply both sides by 64: 32*64= V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3=2048, so V = cube root of 2048, which is 2^(11/3). That is correct.\n\nSo answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph. That is the final answer.\n\nWe can also compute approximate value: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = 2^3 *2^(0.6666)=8*1.5874=12.6992 mph approx.\n\nThus answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4) mph or about 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. I'll produce answer in final message. I'll produce final answer message in the final answer message.\n\nI'll produce answer message in final answer message: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}} or \\boxed{2^{11/3}\\ \\text{mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer message in final answer message.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nSo, V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express this as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 \u221b(2\u00b2) = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate value, note that \u221b4 is about 1.587, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So relation: P = k * A * V^3. Given that when V = 8 mph, A = 2 sq ft, P = 4 pounds. Solve for constant k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now given new scenario: A = 4 sq ft, P = 32 pounds, find V. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, i.e. 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^? Let's check: 2^11 = 2048. So V^3 = 2^11, then V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. But check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666) approximates? But maybe we want an exact expression. Alternatively, we can compute cube root of 2048: 2048^(1/3) = 12.7? Let's see: 12.7^3 ~ 2048? Actually 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 2048. So maybe we want to simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). Alternatively, we can check: if V = 16 mph? Let's check: 16^3 = 4096, not 2048. So it's not 16 mph. But wait, let's check: 8 mph cube is 512, so scaling factor: 2^? Wait, we can solve: V^3 = 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3). But maybe we want decimal approximate: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6667) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6667) = 8 * cube root of 2^2 = 8 * cube root of 4. Cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, so V approx = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But check: 12.699 mph. But wait, check: (1/256)*4*(12.699^3) approximates 32? Let's check: 12.699^3 approximates 2048 exactly. So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph or approximately 12.70 mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But wait, can we simplify further? Actually, 2^(11/3) = (2^3)*(2^(2/3)) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express as cube root of 2048 mph. But 2^(2/3) is not 2^(1/3)? Wait, let's check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want a simplified fraction: cube root of 4 is not a rational number. So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, let's check: given k = 1/256, then P = (1/256)*A*V^3. For A=4, P=32, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). Yes.\n\nThus answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph. However, let's check: 8 mph gives 4 pounds on 2 ft^2. Then 4 ft^2 gives double area, so pressure doubles if velocity constant. But if we want pressure 32 pounds, then factor is 8 times bigger than 4 pounds, but then the velocity must be adjusted. Let's check: if velocity is v, then P \u221d v^3, so v^3 must be 8 times bigger than when v=8 mph? But 8^3 = 512, so 8*512=4096, so v^3=4096, then v= cube root of 4096 = 16 mph. Wait, let's check: Actually, let's recalc: For A=2, P=4, then k = 4/(2*(8^3)) = 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. For A=4, if we want P=32, then equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*v^3, so v^3 = 32*256/4=32*64=2048, v= cube root of 2048. But cube root of 2048 is not 16 mph because 16^3=4096. So let's recalc: 8 mph gives 512. Then doubling area gives 1024 if velocity constant. To get 32 pounds, factor is 32/4=8 times bigger than original pressure. So v^3 must be 8 times bigger than 512, i.e. 512*8=4096. Wait, check: originally, for A=2 and v=8 mph, pressure=4. If we double the area to 4, then with the same velocity, pressure would double to 8, not 32. But we want 32, which is 4 times 8. So v must be increased such that v^3 is 4 times greater than 512, i.e. v^3=512*4=2048. Wait, check: 512*4=2048, not 4096. Let's recalc: For A=2 and v=8 mph, pressure=4. Then if we double area to 4, then for same velocity, pressure=8. But we want 32, which is 4 times 8, so v^3 must be 4 times bigger than 512, i.e. 512*4=2048. Then v = cube root of 2048. But cube root of 2048 is not 16 mph because 16^3=4096, but 12.7^3 is about 2048, so v is about 12.7 mph. Let's check: 12.7^3 approximates 2048, yes.\n\nWait, check consistency: For A=2, v=8 mph, P=4. For A=4, v=12.7 mph, then P = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3). 12.7^3 approximates 2048, then P= (1/256)*4*2048 = (4*2048)/256=8192/256=32, so it's consistent.\n\nBut let's check: 12.7^3 exactly equals? Actually, 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7. Let me compute: 12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7 equals 2048.383, so approximate. But the exact value is 2^(11/3) mph. So answer: v = 2^(11/3) mph, approximately 12.70 mph. But wait, let me re-check: Pressure P = k * A * V^3, k=1/256, A=4, P=32. Then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, multiply both sides by 256 gives: 32*256 = 4*V^3, then V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (32*64)=2048. So V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3). So answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can write as: V = 2^(11/3) mph. We can also express as: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. That is the exact answer.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, but let me check: For A=2, V=8 mph, then V^3=512, then k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. For A=4, then P= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3. So to have P=32, we need (1/64)*V^3=32, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3). So that's consistent.\n\nThus answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll provide final answer in boxed answer.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a final answer message in a final answer message. We'll include explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer with boxed answer: \\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{12.70 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer message.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, we have\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, this becomes\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nNow, we are given A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds. Plug these into the formula:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus,\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis is the exact value of the wind velocity. If you wish to approximate it numerically, note that\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, we get\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ mph}}\u2003\u2003\u2003(or approximately 12.70 mph).",

            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" This is a joint variation problem. Let P = k A V^3. We know that when A=2, V=8, then P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then we want: when A=4, P=32, then 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So solve for V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3, so 8192 = 4 V^3, then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11=2048, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)? Wait check: 2^11 = 2048, cube root gives 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But perhaps we want a simpler representation? Alternatively, we can check: maybe 2048 = 8^3? 8^3=512, no 8^3=512. 16^3=4096, 17^3=4913, so no. Wait, let's check: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, 17^3=4913, so no integer cube. Possibly we can simplify: 2^(11/3) is not simplified. But maybe we want to simplify to radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express as: V = 8*(2^(2/3)) mph. But maybe we want decimal approximations? Let's check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4 = approximately 1.5874, so then V ~ 8*1.5874 = 12.699 mph, approx 12.70 mph. But let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666) = about 12.7 mph. But wait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.66666) = 8*2^(2/3). But wait, 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 8* (cube root of 4) mph.\n\nWait, I must recalc carefully: Given that P = k A V^3, k=1/256. Then for A=4, P=32, so equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Now factor 2048: 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph, or V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. But note: 2^(2/3)= cube root of (2^2)= cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4) mph, which is approximately 8*1.5874=12.699 mph. But let me check: 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666)= about 12.7 mph. So answer: about 12.70 mph. But wait, check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also write answer as V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But let me check: 8* cube root of 4 = 8*(cube root of 4) mph. Alternatively, we can express it as V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also check: (8 cube root of 4)^3 = 8^3 * cube root of 4^3 = 512*4=2048, which is consistent.\n\nSo answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI can also express answer as: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}} mph, or about 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box. We'll produce answer with reasoning steps.\n\nI'll produce answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll produce answer. We'll produce final answer. We'll produce answer. We'll produce answer. We'll produce answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 (since 8\u00b3 = 512)\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nMultiply both sides by 256 to eliminate the fraction:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20038192 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192 / 4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4 (because 2^(2/3) = \u221b(2\u00b2) = \u221b4), we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate value, note that \u221b4 \u2248 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",
