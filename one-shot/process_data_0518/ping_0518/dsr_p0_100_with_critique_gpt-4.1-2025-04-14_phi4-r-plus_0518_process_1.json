            "solution": "We are given problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have the relationship: P = k * A * V^3. Given that when V = 8 mph and A=2, then P = 4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4= k*2*512 = k*1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we need to find V when A=4 and P=32. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor 2048: 2^11 = 2048. So cube root: V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want a decimal approximate? Alternatively, we can simplify: 2^(2/3) is about 2^(0.66667) approx 1.5874. So V approx = 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph, approximately 12.7 mph. But maybe the answer is expressed in radical form: 8 * cube root(4) mph? Let's check: 2^(2/3) = cube root(2^2) = cube root(4). So answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph. Wait, check: 8 * cube root(4) mph. But is that correct? Let's check: (8 cube root 4)^3 = 512 * 4 = 2048, yes.\n\nWait, but we can also do: V = cube root of (32*64) = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nLet's check: 8 cube root of 4 mph is approximately 8*1.5874= 12.699 mph. Yes.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approx)}}.\n\nI'll provide the answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer. I'll produce answer with steps.\n\nI'll produce answer: The answer is: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the constant:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Calculate 32 \u00d7 64:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048, so V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nLet's denote that P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: P=4, A=2, V=8 mph. Then 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when P=32, A=4. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now cube root of 2048 equals? Factor 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)? Actually 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: V = 8 * cube root of 4? Wait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3+2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But then 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2^2, which is the cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2048 approx 12.7 mph. But let's see if we can simplify: 2048 = 2^11. The cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, which is about 12.7 mph. Alternatively, we can solve exactly: V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, check: Actually 8 mph gives 4 pounds. Then 4 square feet at 12.7 mph gives pressure: P = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3). Let's check approximate: 12.7^3 approx 2048, so P= (4/256)*2048= (1/64)*2048=32. So that's consistent.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is cube root of 2048 mph, which is 8*2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also express it as: V = 8 * (cube root of 4) mph. Let's see: Actually cube root of 4 = 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nWait, let's check: 8*(cube root of 4) is 8*(cube root of 4) mph. But 8 * cube root of 4 is 8*(approx 1.5874) = 12.699 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph, or \\boxed{8\\cdot2^{2/3}} mph, or approximately \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll provide final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. We'll check: When velocity is 8 mph, pressure is 4 pounds. For 4 sq ft, 32 pounds, then V= cube root of 2048 mph. But I'll produce answer as: V= cube root of 2048 mph = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}. We'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given data:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nSubstitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Find V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) mph\n\nThis is the exact answer. For an approximate value, note that 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" We'll denote constant as k. So formula: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V=8, A=2, P=4, so 4 = k*2*(8^3). 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 *512 = k *1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then second scenario: P=32, A=4, unknown velocity V. Then 32 = k *4 * V^3, but k=1/256, so 32= (1/256)*4 * V^3 = (4/256) V^3 = (1/64) V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V= cube root of 2048. We can compute: 2048= 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So V = 8 * cube root of 4. But wait, check: 8* cube root of 4 = approximate 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph. But let me see if that's correct. Let's check: Actually, we need to check: V^3 = 2048, cube root of 2048 is 12.699? Wait, compute: cube root of 2048 = 12.699? Let's check: 12.7^3 is 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7 = 12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7 = 2048.383, yes. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph. But maybe we want an exact answer in radical form: V = 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can express as cube root of 2048 exactly: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 +2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V=8*2^(2/3) mph. That is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to express in radical form: V=8* cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want a decimal approximation: approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nLet's check: if V=12.70 mph, then V^3 = 12.70^3 approx= 12.70^3= 12.7*12.7*12.7= 2048, then pressure P= k * A * V^3= (1/256)*4*2048= (4*2048)/256= 8192/256= 32, which is correct.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with reasoning.

Find the constant k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nSubstitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) mph\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer a radical form, note that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 mph\n\nFor a numerical approximation, calculate \u221b4 \u2248 1.5874, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given that \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3. We are told that when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So then k = 4/(2*512) = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we want: find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So we have: 32 = k * 4 * V^3, where k=1/256. So equation becomes: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64=2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now solve for V: V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048: 2048=2^11, since 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3). But if we want a decimal, we can compute: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = about 12.7 mph? Wait, let's check: 2^(3)=8, 2^(4)=16, so cube root of 2048 is between 12 and 13. Let's compute: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But maybe we want an exact expression. But perhaps the answer is in radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= (2^(2/3))*2^(3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But then maybe not simpler. Alternatively, 2048= 8*256, so cube root of 2048= cube root of (8*256)= cube root of 8 * cube root of 256= 2 * cube root of 256. But cube root of 256= cube root of (2^8)=2^(8/3). So that equals 2^(11/3) as before.\n\nWe can also find approximate value: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.6667)= about 12.7 mph, but let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 2048. So answer: V = 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, check: Actually 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3) and 2^(2/3)= about 1.5874, so product=8*1.5874= 12.6992 mph approx.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer: The wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer in box. Let me produce answer with steps.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}. But let me check: Wait, check: 2 mph? Let's check: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3, so k= 4/(2*512)=4/1024=0.00390625, then 32 = 0.00390625 * 4 * V^3, so V^3=32/(0.015625)=32/0.015625=2048, V = cube root of 2048=12.7 mph approx. Yes.\n\nI'll produce final answer. We'll produce answer with the reasoning: Pressure P= k A V^3, find k, then solve.\n\nI'll produce answer with final answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}. We'll produce final answer in text: The wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003So, 4 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Thus, k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003We are given that when A = 4 ft\u00b2, P = 32 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003So, 32 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the right side:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048.\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048.\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\u2003\u2003This can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nStep 4. Approximate the value:\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.6992 mph.\n\u2003\u2003Rounded to one decimal place, V \u2248 12.7 mph.\n\nThus, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\n\\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have P = k A V^3, where k is constant. Then given: when velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. So 4 = k * 2 * (8)^3. 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So we have 32 = k * 4 * V^3, where k = 1/256. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (V^3)/64, so then V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Let's see: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But maybe we want to simplify to radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph, but that's not a nice number. Alternatively, maybe we can compute approximate value: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666) = approx 12.7 mph. But let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 2048? Let's recalc: 12.7^3 is around 12.7^3 = 2048. So answer: V = cube root of 2048, which is exactly 2^(11/3) mph. But perhaps we want to simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. So answer: wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph. That is the exact answer. But wait: Let's check: 8 * cube root of 4, cube root of 4 is about 1.587, then product is about 12.7 mph, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph? Let's check: cube root of 4 = 4^(1/3) is not 1.587, but wait, 4^(1/3) ~ 1.587. So product 8*1.587 = 12.696 mph. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 factorization: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3). That is the simplest form.\n\nWe can also solve: V^3 = 2048, then V = 2048^(1/3). But I think the answer is: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8 * 4^(1/3). But that is not simpler than 2^(11/3). Alternatively, note that 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when velocity V=8 mph, area A=2, pressure P=4. So we plug: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then for new condition: pressure P=32, area A=4, and unknown velocity V. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. Multiply: (1/256)*4 = 4/256 = 1/64. So equation becomes: 32 = (1/64)* V^3, then multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. So then V = cube root of 2048. Let's see: 2048 = 2^? Actually 2048 = 2^11. Wait check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3)? Alternatively, we can simplify: V = 2^(11/3). But perhaps we want a decimal approximation? Actually problem likely expects an answer in radical form: V = 2^(11/3). Alternatively, we can simplify as: 2^(11/3)= (2^3) * 2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But check if that is acceptable. Let's check if maybe we can get a simplified radical expression: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so answer becomes: 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want approximate value: 8* (cube root of 4) approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so product is about 12.699, so approximately 12.7 mph. But likely answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 8^3=512, so k=4/1024=1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, then 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32= (4/256) V^3 = (1/64) V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, and V= cube root of 2048. We can factor: 2048=2^11, so V=2^(11/3)=2^3 *2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8* cube root of 4 miles per hour. But wait, check: cube root of 4 is not simplified to a rational number, so answer is in radical form. Alternatively, if we want an approximate value: about 12.7 mph.\n\nLet's check: 12.7 mph, cube velocity: 12.7^3= about 2048, yes.\n\nThus answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, answer: 2^(11/3) mph. So I'll answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer in text with final answer. I'll produce final answer in the box.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.

This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Solving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify (1/256) \u00b7 4:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3)\n\u2003\u2003This can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\u2003miles per hour.",
