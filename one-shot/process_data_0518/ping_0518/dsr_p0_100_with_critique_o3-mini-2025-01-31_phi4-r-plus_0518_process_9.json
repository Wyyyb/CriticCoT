            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant of proportionality.\n\nGiven: when V = 8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P = 4 lbs. So plug: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find wind velocity when P = 32, A = 4. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Let's see: 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11 = 2048, but cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want to find exact value: V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 approx? Let's check: cube root of 2048 is exactly 2048^(1/3). We can simplify: 2048=2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait check: 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, so V = 2048^(1/3). Let's compute approximate: cube root of 2048 is approximately 12.7 mph. But maybe we want an exact expression: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we want to check: is that what is required? The problem statement: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph. Let me check: 2^11 = 2048, cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) approximates 12.7 mph. But wait, check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 1.6 = 12.8 mph, but I'll compute more precisely: cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph. Let me compute exactly: 12.7^3 = 12.7^3 = 2048.383? Actually I'll compute exactly: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048.383, so that's close enough.\n\nWait, but the problem probably expects an exact answer. Let me check the relation: P = k * A * V^3, k = 1/256. Then for given P=32, A=4, equation becomes: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256) V^3 = (1/64)V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, and then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify: 2^(2/3)= (cube root of 4). So answer: V=8 cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want to express answer as: V=8 cube root of 4 mph. But let me check: The cube root of 4 is not a nice number. Perhaps we can leave answer as cube root of 2048 mph.\n\nI can also check: 2^(11/3) mph. That is the simplest exact form. Alternatively, if we want a decimal: approximately 12.7 mph. But the problem likely expects an exact answer.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}.\n\nWait, but I need to check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024.\n\u2003\u2003Solving for k gives:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nStep 2. Use k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the right side:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64.\n\u2003\u2003So, 32 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048.\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048.\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we can also write:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4.\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}.",

That means we have the relationship:\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3,\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\n\u2022 The correct approach involves finding k using the given condition, then using the relationship with the new values to solve for V.\n\nStep 2. Verification of the Student\u2019s Solution:\n\u2022 The student correctly sets up the equation as P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Substituting the given values (when V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lbs), they obtain:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3).\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024,\nso k = 4/1024 = 1/256, which is correct.\n\u2022 For the second part, with P = 32 lbs and A = 4 ft\u00b2, they correctly set up:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplifying, (1/256) \u00b7 4 = 1/64, so:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\nMultiplying both sides by 64 gives:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048.\n\u2022 Finally, the student writes V = \u221b2048, recognizes that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, and expresses the cube root in terms of powers of 2:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4.\nThis is the correct expression for the wind velocity.\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have P = k * A * V^3. We are given: when velocity is 8 mph, pressure is 4 pounds, and sail area is 2 square feet. So P = 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So equation: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now next: find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So we have: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. Solve for V^3: multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 * V^3. So 32 * 256 = 8192? Let's check: 32 * 256 = 8192. So equation: 8192 = 4 * V^3, then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. So then V = cube root of 2048. Now factor 2048: 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10 = 1024, 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) which is not a nice integer. Alternatively, we can solve: V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = 2 * cube root of 256? Not exactly. Let's check: Actually, 2048 = 8 * 256 = 8 * 256, but cube root of 8 is 2, so V = 2 * cube root of 256, but 256 is 2^8, so cube root of 256 = 2^(8/3) = 2^(2 + 2/3) = 4 * 2^(2/3)? That is not simpler.\n\nWait, let me recalc: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). That is not an integer. But maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity = 8 * cube root of 4? Actually 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, but that doesn't simplify to a nice number. Let's check: Actually, 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4, so answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph. But perhaps we can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = (2^(1/3))^11, no that's not simpler.\n\nWait, let me re-check the arithmetic: P = (1/256) * A * V^3. When A=2, V=8, then V^3 = 512, and 2*512 =1024, times (1/256) equals 1024/256 =4, which is correct. For second scenario, A=4, P=32, so equation becomes: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = 32*64 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) mph. That is the answer. Let's see if we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately? Let's compute approximate value: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8*1.5874=12.699. Let me check: 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approximately. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph. However, the problem might expect an exact answer in radical form: V = 8 * \u221b4 mph, or V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nLet me check if the answer is exactly 2^(11/3) mph. But wait, 2^(11/3) is not a nice number. Alternatively, we can write it as 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI can simplify further: 2^(11/3) mph is the simplest exact form. Alternatively, if we want a decimal approximation, it's about 12.7 mph.\n\nLet me check: V^3 = 2048, cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2048. 12.7^3 = 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = maybe approximate 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 = 161.29, times 12.7 = 2048.383, which is nearly 2048. So yes.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph or 8\u221b4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, but wait: The problem said \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" I must check: The pressure is 32 pounds, area is 4, so equation: 32 = k * 4 * V^3, k=1/256, so 32= (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, same.\n\nThus answer: V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph. I can also write it as 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nThus final answer: wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or 8\u221b4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus I'll output: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. But maybe I'll say: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph, which is the exact answer.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph. But I'll check: Actually, 2^(11/3) mph is equal to 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, which is the same as 8\u221b4 mph.

This means that\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nNow, when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we have:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nMultiply both sides by 256 to eliminate the fraction:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 256:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192\nSo,\n\u2003\u20038192 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192/4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\nNotice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\nThis can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is exactly\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}.",

Given: P = 4, A = 2, V = 8, so 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then we use new: P = 32, A = 4, unknown V. Then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) but we need to find a simpler value.

But maybe we can simplify: 2048 = 2^11. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can say V = 8 * cube root of 4? Let me check: Actually, 2048 = 64*32? Let me recalc: 32*64 = 2048, so V^3=32*64, but that doesn't simplify. Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) which is the answer.\n\nWait: But maybe the problem expects a numerical answer. Let me check: The problem states: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4? Let's check: Actually, let's recalc: 2048 = 2^11 = 2^(9+2) = 512*4 = 2048. Wait, I'm trying to express cube root in simpler form: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2^2, which is cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 4 is not an integer. Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3). But wait, let me check: Actually, 8^3 = 512, 9^3 = 729, 10^3=1000, 11^3=1331, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197. So 2048 is not a perfect cube. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, then multiplied by 8 gives about 12.699 mph, approximately 12.7 mph. But let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 is exactly 8 * 4^(1/3). Alternatively, we can express it as 2^(11/3). Which is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve the equation: (1/256)*4*V^3=32, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) mph. But wait, 2^(11/3) is not a nice number. Let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) which is about 12.7 mph. But wait, did we get 4*V^3/256=32? Multiply both sides by 256: 4V^3 = 32*256=8192, so V^3=8192/4=2048, same result.\n\nThus answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph. But wait, check: 8 mph is given, then pressure on 2 sq ft is 4 pounds. So if we double the area to 4, then pressure doubles to 8 pounds if velocity remains same. But then to get 32 pounds, we need 4 times the pressure, so V^3 must be 4 times bigger, so V must be cube root of 4 times bigger than 8 mph, which is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is consistent with our answer.\n\nLet me check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph is approximately 8*1.5874=12.699 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: V \u2248 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, check: Actually, 8 * cube root of 4 mph is exactly the same as 2^(3)*2^(2/3)=2^(11/3). So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, V = 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer in final message. I'll produce final answer in a box with explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph, or \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph.

So then k = P/(A * V^3) = 4 / (2 * 8^3) = 4 / (2 * 512) = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we want: when A=4 ft^2, P=32 pounds, find V. So we have 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 * V^3. But 32*256 = 8192, but let's check: 256 * 32 = 8192. So equation becomes: 8192 = 4 * V^3, then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. But note: 2048 = 2^11. Actually 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)? Wait: 11/3 = 3 + 2/3, so V = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. But we can also check: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) which is not a whole number. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer in radical form. But wait, maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. But we can also compute approximate: 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so V ~ 8*1.5874 = 12.699 mph, about 12.7 mph. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer: \"8*2^(2/3)\" mph.\n\nLet's check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, so answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But wait, maybe we can find a nicer form: Let x = cube root of 4 mph, so answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 8 * (4)^(1/3) mph.\n\nLet's check: using our constant: k = 1/256, then P = (1/256)*A*V^3, so for A=4 and P=32, then V^3 = (32*256)/4 = 8192/4 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, which is the exact answer.\n\nWe can also check: (2^(2/3)) ~ 1.5874, so V ~ 12.699 mph. But perhaps the answer is expected as an exact expression: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI check: cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. Let me check: 12.7^3 = 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 12.7^2 = 161.29, times 12.7 = 2048.383, so yes.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph. But let me check: Actually, 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But wait: cube root of 4 is not 2^(2/3) but same. So answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nWait, but then check: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8* (4^(1/3)) mph. But note: 4^(1/3) is not the same as 2^(2/3)? Yes, they are the same because 4 = 2^2, so 4^(1/3) = 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nWe can also express it as V = 2^(11/3) mph. But I think it's simplest to say: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also check: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8 * (cube root of 4) mph. But I can check: 4^(1/3) ~ 1.5874, so product ~ 12.699 mph.

Given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft^2, then P = 4 lb. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). But 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So we have: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 * V^3.

Let's check: cube root of 2048. 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so it's between 12 and 13 mph. But wait, let's check: Actually, I need to re-check: We had: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3. 32*256 = 8192, then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. So yes. Now cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further? Possibly the answer is best expressed as 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or we can approximate. Alternatively, we can express it as 2^(11/3). The question might be from a contest or math problem, so maybe they want an exact answer in simplest radical form. We can write: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can write: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Because 2^(2/3) = cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want a decimal approximation: cube root of 4 is approx 1.5874, then times 8 gives 12.699, so approx 12.70 mph.\n\nLet's check: Alternatively, we can try to see if the given numbers are consistent. Let me check: For V=8 mph, pressure=4. For V=12.7 mph, pressure = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3). But 12.7^3 is around 2048, then 4/256=0.015625, times 2048 equals 32. So yes.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or equivalently 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nWe can check: 8 mph cube gives 512, multiplied by 2 gives 1024, constant is 1/256, so pressure is 4. Then for 4 square feet, wind velocity V must satisfy: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so V = cube root of 2048. So yes.\n\nThus final answer: V = cube root of 2048 = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. I'll now produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a boxed environment: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce explanation: The pressure P is given by P = kAV^3, find k, then substitute new values.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer. We'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k.\nWe are given that when V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, the pressure P is 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, this becomes:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant to find the new wind velocity.\nNow, we need to find V when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds. Substitute these values and k into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 256 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 256:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192\n\nSo we have:\n\n\u2003\u20038192 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192 / 4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V.\nWe need to take the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2. Since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nRecognize that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2\u00b2, which is the cube root of 4. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nIf you wish to approximate this value, note that \u221b4 is approximately 1.587, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe can denote the relation: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, then P = 4. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. So the formula is: P = (1/256)*A*V^3.\n\nWe want to find V when A = 4 and P = 32. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3. So 8192 = 4*V^3, hence V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11 = 2048. But wait, check: 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). But that doesn't simplify nicely. Let me check: maybe we can simplify further: Actually, let me check: 8^3 = 512, 9^3=729, 10^3=1000, etc. Wait, no, 8 mph was given. Let's recalc: k = 4/(2*512)= 4/1024= 1/256. So then the equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32=4/256 * V^3= (1/64)*V^3, then multiply both sides by 64: 32*64= V^3, 32*64= 2048, so V^3= 2048, so V= cube root of 2048. But cube root of 2048 is not an integer. Let's check: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But let me check if the problem expects a fractional answer: But wait, the given values: when V=8 mph, P=4, then with 4 square feet and P=32, then V should be bigger. But 8 mph is less than 12 mph, so answer is 8? That doesn't seem consistent. Let's recalc: The relation is P \u221d A*V^3, so if we double the area, then pressure doubles for same V. And if we want to double pressure from 4 to 32, that's an 8 times increase, so V should be cube root of 8 = 2 times bigger than the original velocity. So if V=8 mph originally, then 2 times bigger is 16 mph. But wait, check: Actually, if we double the area from 2 to 4, the pressure doubles, so to get from 4 to 32, that's an 8 times increase in pressure, so V^3 must be 8 times bigger, so V must be 2 times bigger than 8 mph, which is 16 mph. Let's check: P = (1/256)*4*(16^3). 16^3=4096, so (1/256)*4*4096= (4/256)*4096= (1/64)*4096= 64, not 32. That doesn't match. Wait, let's recalc: Let's re-read the problem carefully: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So P = k*A*V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, and A=2, then P=4. So we get: 4 = k*2*(8^3) = k*2*512= k*1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find V when A=4, P=32: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, and V = cube root of 2048. Now cube root of 2048 is not 16. Let's check: 16^3 = 4096, so it's half that, so cube root of 2048 is 16/ (2^(1/3)? Wait, let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is not 16. Let me check: 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so V approx equals 8*1.5874 = 12.699. That is about 12.7 mph. But wait, then check: if V=12.7 mph, then V^3 approx equals 2048, then P approx equals (1/256)*4*2048 = (4/256)*2048 = (1/64)*2048 = 32, so it's consistent.\n\nBut wait, there's another way: The relation is P \u221d A V^3. So if we double A, then P doubles for same V. So to get from 4 to 32, that's an 8 times increase in pressure. So V^3 must be 8 times bigger, so V must be 2 times bigger. So then V should be 16 mph if the area were the same as the original. But here the area is doubled, so the increase in pressure is not solely due to velocity change. Let's do it systematically:\n\nLet initial condition: P1 = k*A1*V1^3 = k*2*8^3 = k*2*512 = k*1024 = 4, so k=4/1024=1/256.\n\nNow new condition: P2 = k*A2*V2^3 = (1/256)*4*V2^3 = (4/256)*V2^3 = (1/64)*V2^3 = 32. Multiply both sides by 64: V2^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V2 = cube root of 2048. 2048= 2^11, so V2 = 2^(11/3). 2^(11/3) is not a nice integer. Let's simplify: 2^(11/3)= 2^(9/3+2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, approximate: 2^(2/3) \u2248 1.5874, so V \u2248 8*1.5874 = 12.699 mph, about 12.7 mph.\n\nBut let me check: if the wind velocity is 12.7 mph, then the pressure on 4 square feet is: P = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3). Let's check approximate: 12.7^3 approximates 12.7*12.7*12.7= 2048? Wait, 12.7^3 approximates 2048 exactly because we solved that earlier. So yes, that works.\n\nWait, but the earlier reasoning \"if we double the area, then pressure doubles, so to get from 4 to 32, that's an 8 times increase, so V must be 2 times bigger\" is not valid because the relationship is not directly proportional to V^3? Let's re-read: \"varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity.\" That means P \u221d A V^3. So if we double A, then for same V, pressure doubles. So if we want pressure to be 8 times larger than before (4 to 32 is an 8 times increase), then if we had kept area constant at 2, then V^3 must be 8 times larger, so V would be 2 times bigger, i.e. 16 mph. But here A is doubled (4 instead of 2), so the combined effect is: new pressure = (2*V^3) compared to old pressure with area 2. Wait, let's reframe: Let initial condition be: P \u221d A*V^3. For the initial condition, let the constant be k. So P1 = k*2*8^3 = k*1024 = 4, so k= 1/256. For the new condition, with A=4, we want P2 = 32. Then P2 = (1/256)*4*V2^3 = (1/64)*V2^3. Set equal to 32: V2^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So V2 = cube root of 2048. Now, compare with the scenario if we had kept area constant at 2 and increased velocity: P would be (1/256)*2*V^3. To get P=32, we require (1/256)*2*V^3 = 32, so V^3 = 32*256/2 = 32*128 = 4096, so V = cube root of 4096 = cube root of 2^12 = 2^(12/3)=2^4=16 mph. So indeed, if the area had remained 2, then the velocity needed would be 16 mph. But here the area is doubled, so the required velocity is lower. Let's compute: V2 = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (4096/2) = cube root of 4096 divided by cube root of 2 = 16 / cube root of 2 = 16 / 2^(1/3)= 16 / 2^(1/3). And 16/2^(1/3)= 16*2^(-1/3)= 2^4*2^(-1/3)= 2^(4 - 1/3)= 2^(11/3) which is what we had. And that equals 2^(11/3) mph. And 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so that equals about 12.7 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI must present final answer in a box: \\boxed{8\\cdot2^{2/3}} mph, or \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.
