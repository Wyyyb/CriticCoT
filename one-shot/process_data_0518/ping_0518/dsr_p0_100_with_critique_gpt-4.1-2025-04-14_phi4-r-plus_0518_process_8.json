            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Let me check: Variation: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when V=8, A=2, P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now we want: find V when A=4, P=32, using formula: 32 = (1/256)*4* V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. So then V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * cube root of 2^2 = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can check: cube root of 2048 approximates: 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3=12.7^3= about 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7*12.7= 2048. So answer: V = 12.7 mph approximated? Let's compute precisely: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * (cube root of 4). So answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait, check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, so answer is exactly that. Alternatively, we can simplify: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we want a decimal approximation. Let me compute: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, times 8 is 12.6992 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph. But the answer should be in exact form: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait: Let me check the given: \"varies jointly as A and the cube of V\". So P = k A V^3. So using given: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for A=4, P=32: 32 = (1/256)*4* V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. So answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nI can also simplify: 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want a decimal, it's approx 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. I'll produce final answer with explanation. We'll produce final answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003Substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Find V by taking the cube root of 2048:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2\u00b2 (which is 4), we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nSo, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate numerical value, note that \u221b4 is about 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}",

Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So then: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then for pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds, find wind velocity V such that: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute cube root of 2048. Factor: 2048=2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V^3 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3). That is not an integer. Let's check: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we can simplify further: Actually, let's compute approximate value: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, multiplied by 8 gives about 12.6992 mph. But maybe they want answer in radical form: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or 2^(11/3) mph, or maybe we can check if we made error: Let's check: 4 square feet, V= ? using P= (1/256)*4*V^3 = (V^3)/64, so P=32 => V^3 = 2048. Factor: 2048=8^3=512? Wait, check: 8^3=512, not 2048. So V= cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11, so V=2^(11/3) mph. But maybe it can be simplified: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3)=8* cube root of 4. That is the answer.\n\nWait, let's check: cube root of 4 is about 1.587, multiplied by 8 gives 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, but check: Alternatively, maybe we can use ratio: P1/A1/V^3 = constant, but then P2= k * A2 * V^3, so ratio: P1/P2 = (A1*V1^3)/(A2*V2^3). Solve for V2. But anyway.\n\nI must check: Given P= k A V^3, with k=1/256. For second scenario: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048. So V= cube root of 2048. 2^(11/3)=8*2^(2/3) = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph.

So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we have new conditions: P=32, A=4, find V. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = (4/256) V^3 = (1/64) V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor: 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11=2048. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8 * cube root of 4.

Cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4, but it's not a nice number. Alternatively, we can solve V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048.

Let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 2048? Actually, 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = (12.7*12.7=161.29) *12.7 = 2048.383, so yes, about 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let's check: Actually, 12.7^3 ~ 2048, yes.\n\nBut wait, let's re-check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => (4/256) = 1/64, so equation becomes V^3 = 32*64 = 2048.

Find k using the given information:\n\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003Substitute k, A, and P into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So P = k * A * V^3. Given: When V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, and P=4 pounds. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So k = 1/256.\n\nNow we want: find the wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. So 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, because 4/256 = 1/64. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Solve V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V^3=2^11. So V = 2^(11/3). But maybe we want to simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want a decimal approximation. 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4) mph. Alternatively, if we want to compute cube root of 2048. Alternatively, if we want a decimal approximation: cube root of 2048 is approx? Let's compute: cube root of 2048 = exp( (1/3)*ln(2048) ) = exp( (1/3)*(ln(2048) )). But easier: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so V is between 12 and 13 mph. But the exact answer is V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait check: 8*(cube root of 4) mph, is that correct? Let's check: (8 * cube root of 4)^3 = 512 * 4 = 2048, yes. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut also note that the problem is from a textbook, so probably answer in terms of radicals: V = 8 * 4^(1/3) mph, or simplified as 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can find cube root of 2048 exactly: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*(cube root of 4). So answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4) mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4) mph. Alternatively, we can approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so V ~ 12.699 mph approx.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph. We'll put answer in box. We'll put final answer in box.

We are given: When V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, P=4 pounds. So 4 = k * 2 * (8)^3. 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now find velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, i.e. 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) but not a nice integer. Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. But is there an integer? 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between. Let's see: 2048^(1/3)= about 12.7 mph. But maybe the answer is in terms of cube roots? Wait check: Actually, let me recalc: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 gives V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64=2048, yes. And cube root of 2048 equals cube root of (2^11) equals 2^(11/3)=2^(3.666...)= approx 12.7 mph. But maybe we can simplify to 8 * cube root of 4?

So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut maybe it's easier: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => V^3 = 32 * (256/4)=32*64=2048. So V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So the relationship: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Then we have given: when velocity V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, P=4 pounds. So substitute: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). But 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 *512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So constant k= 1/256.\n\nNow we want: find wind velocity when pressure is 32 pounds on 4 square feet. So use formula: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, solve for V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3, so 8192 = 4*V^3, then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. Now we need cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11 because 2^11 = 2048, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) but wait let me check: Actually, 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But maybe we want approximate value or simplified radical? Let's check: Actually, cube root of 2048 is not an integer. Alternatively, we can write it as: V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But if we want a decimal, 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4 approx. 1.5874, so V approx = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But maybe it expects answer in radical form. Alternatively, we can solve it exactly: V = cube root(2048) = cube root(2^11) = 2^(11/3). That is acceptable.\n\nBut maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * cube root(4). So answer: V = 8 * cube root(4) mph. But then check: 8 * cube root(4) = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But wait, check if that is correct: Let's recompute: k=1/256, then P= (1/256)*4*V^3, so P= (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so 32= (1/64)*V^3 => V^3=32*64=2048, so yes.\n\nBut the question says \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = cube root(2048) mph = 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nBut wait, check: 2^(11/3) is not exactly 12.7 mph, it's 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) approx = e^(3.6666 * ln2) = e^(2.539) approx = 12.66 mph. Wait, let me recalc: ln2=0.693, so 3.6666*0.693 = 2.54, e^(2.54)=12.7 mph. So yes.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 cube root(4) mph or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, but let me check: 8* cube root(4) = 8 * 4^(1/3) = 8 * (cube root of 4) = 8 * (approx 1.5874) = 12.6992 mph approx. So answer: about 12.7 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve for cube root exactly: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). That is acceptable answer.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer.\n\nI'll produce answer in a final answer box: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph} \\text{ (approximately 12.7 mph)}}.\n\nI'll produce answer accordingly.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb, substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Solve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis is the exact value of the wind velocity. To express it in a slightly different form:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we can also write:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nStep 4. Approximate the value:\n\u2003\u2003\u221b4 \u2248 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.6992 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ mph, which is approximately } 12.7 \\text{ mph}}",
