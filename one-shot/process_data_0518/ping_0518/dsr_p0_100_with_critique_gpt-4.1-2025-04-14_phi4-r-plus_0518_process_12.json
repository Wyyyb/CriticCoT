            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So P = k * A * V^3. Given when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4. So we find constant: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now question: find wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Now factor 2048. 2048 = 2^11, since 2^11=2048. Then cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3) mph. But perhaps simpler: V = cube root of 2048 mph. But 2^(11/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can say V = 8*(2^(2/3)). But maybe we can simplify further. Let's see: 2^(2/3) is not an integer. So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can say V = 8*\u221b(4) mph. Wait, check: 2^(2/3)= (2^(1/3))^2. So answer: V = 8*(2^(1/3))^2 mph, which is equivalent to 8\u221b(4) mph. Alternatively, we can write as: V = 8\u221b(4) mph. But is that acceptable? Alternatively, we can compute approximate: 2^(1/3) approx 1.26, so then V approx 8*1.587 = 12.7 mph approx. Wait check: 2^(2/3)= (cube root of 2)^2 approx 1.2599^2=1.587. Then V approx 8*1.587=12.696 mph approx. But the problem likely expects an exact answer in radical form: V = 8 * \u221b(4) mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph. Let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.666...)= 2^3 *2^(2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer is same. We can also say: V = 8*\u221b4 mph.\n\nLet's check: 8^3=512, 4*512=2048, yes.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nI can also check: 8 mph with pressure 4 pounds, 4 square feet with 32 pounds, wind velocity is increased by factor? Because pressure is proportional to area and cube of velocity. So if area doubles (from 2 to 4) then pressure doubles (4 to 8) if velocity constant, but actually pressure quadrupled (from 4 to 32) so velocity must be increased by factor? Let's check: Pressure = k A V^3. If we double area, then pressure becomes 2*(k A V^3)=2P. But actual pressure is 32 vs 4, which is factor 8. So velocity factor must be cube root of 4, i.e. V factor must be cube root of 4, so new velocity = 8*(cube root of 4) mph. That is consistent with our answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait, 8*(cube root of 4) mph is equal to 8*4^(1/3) mph. But earlier we got 8*2^(2/3) mph, and note 4^(1/3)= 2^(2/3). So it's the same. So answer: V = 8*\u221b4 mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * \u221b4 mph. But check: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.587, so velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll provide final answer in the required format: \"The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph\" or \"8 * 2^(2/3) mph\".\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce final answer with step-by-step explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer. We'll produce answer in the required format.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k.\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, the pressure is P = 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant to find the new wind velocity.\nWe are given a new situation where A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds. Substitute these into the equation with our found k:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nSo,\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V.\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Thus,\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4 (because 4 = 2\u00b2), we can also write:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}.",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have formula: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Then given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, then P = 4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8)^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we want: when pressure P = 32, area A = 4, find V. So we have: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64) * V^3. So then multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3. 32 * 64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can write V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. But maybe it's simpler: 2048 = 8^3? Let's check: 8^3 = 512, not 2048. So not. Alternatively, we can compute cube root of 2048: Let V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 approximates 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 2048? Actually, let's do: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7, but I'll check: 12.7^2 = 161.29, multiplied by 12.7 = 2048.383, so yes. But it's probably expected as exact expression in terms of radicals: V = \u221b2048 = 2^(11/3) mph, or simplified further.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express in radical form: 2^(2/3) = \u221b(2^2) = \u221b4, so answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nBut wait, check: 8\u221b4 mph is the answer. Alternatively, we can compute: 2^(11/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. But maybe we want to express as \"8\u221b4 mph\" mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can also simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8 * 256) = cube root of 8 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of (2^8) = 2 * 2^(8/3) = 2^(1 + 8/3) = 2^(11/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. That is same.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) ~ 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699, so roughly 12.7 mph. So answer: wind velocity is about 12.7 mph. But the question likely expects: V = \u221b2048 mph = 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, check: 8\u221b4 mph: 8\u221b4 mph = 8 * \u221b4 mph, and \u221b4 is about 1.587, product is 12.696, yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can express answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now check: Pressure P = k * A * V^3, k = 1/256, then for A=4, V=8\u221b4 mph, V^3 = (8\u221b4)^3 = 8^3 * 4 = 512 * 4 = 2048, then P = (1/256)*4*2048 = (4/256)*2048 = (1/64)*2048 = 32, correct.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, or equivalently, 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now provide answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now provide final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003So, 4 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024.\n\u2003\u2003Solve for k:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003Now, when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the constant term:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64.\n\u2003\u2003So, 32 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048.\n\u2003\u2003Now, take the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048.\n\nStep 3. Simplify \u221b2048:\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3).\n\u2003\u2003This can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\u2003\u2003Alternatively, since 2^(2/3) = \u221b(2\u00b2) = \u221b4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}\n\nThis is the exact answer, and approximately, 8\u221b4 \u2248 12.7 mph.",

So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find velocity for P=32, A=4, so 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048.

Let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 12.7*161.29= 2048? Actually, 12.7^3 is about 2048. So answer is approximately 12.7 mph. But let me check: Actually, cube root of 2048 exactly equals 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048.0? Let me compute precisely: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7 = 161.29, then multiply by 12.7 yields 2048.383? Actually, let's compute: 12.7 * 161.29 = 2048.383. Actually, let me recompute exactly: 2048^(1/3) equals? Actually, I'll compute: cube root of 2048. 2^11=2048, so cube root = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, so product equals 8*1.5874=12.6992 mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph. So answer: wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or about 12.70 mph.\n\nWait, but let me re-check: P = k A V^3, k=1/256, so for new condition: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer is exactly that.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nWe can also express as: V= 8*(cube root of 4)? Wait, let me check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4, so V= 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But wait, 8 * cube root of 4 is not equal to 8*2^(2/3) because cube root of 4=2^(2/3) indeed. So answer: wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph is 8 * 1.5874= 12.6992 mph, same as previous.\n\nThus answer: V= 8*(cube root of 4) mph, which is exactly 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer in text.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}, or \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{12.70 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = 1024k\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds.\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nSimplify the constant terms:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\nNotice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\nThis can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nStep 4. Approximate the value:\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) \u2248 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.6992 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph} \\text{ (approximately } 12.70 \\text{ mph)}}",

            "solution": "We are given: The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. That means P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. Solve for k: k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we are asked: find wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. That means: 32 = k * 4 * V^3. Use k = 1/256. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64=2048? Let's check: 32*64= 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor: 2048= 2^? Actually 2^11=2048? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3)? But we can also compute: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256)? Not exactly. Let's simplify: 2048 = 8*256 = 8*256. But 256 is 4^4? No, 256=2^8. So 2048=2^3 *2^8=2^11. So cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want a decimal? But maybe we want exact expression: V= 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.66667)= about 12.7 mph. But let's check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.6667)= approximate: 2^3=8, then 2^(0.6667)= about 1.5874, product approx 12.699. So answer is V \u2248 12.7 mph.\n\nHowever, the problem likely expects an exact answer in radical form: cube root of 2048, which can be simplified: 2048= 64*32? Wait, check: 64 * 32=2048. But cube root of 64 is 4, so then cube root of 32 is cube root of 32= 2^(5/3)? That doesn't simplify well.\n\nWait, check: 64 is 4^3? Actually 4^3=64, so cube root of 64=4. So 2048=64*32, cube root = cube root of 64 * cube root of 32 = 4 * cube root of 32. But cube root of 32= cube root of (2^5)= 2^(5/3). So answer is 4*2^(5/3) mph. But note: 2^(5/3)= 2^(1+2/3)= 2*2^(2/3). So that equals 4*2*2^(2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So either answer is V= 8*2^(2/3) mph, which is equivalent to 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWe can check: 8 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * (approx 1.5874)= 12.699. So answer is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nHowever, I'll double-check: k= 1/256, then equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64= 2048, cube root is 2^(11/3) mph. So answer.\n\nThus final answer: wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or about 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in boxed answer. But careful: the problem might want an exact answer in radical form.\n\nI can write: V = cube root of 2048 mph = 8 * cube root of 4 mph? Let's check: 8* cube root of 4 mph? Wait, 8* cube root of 4= 8*(4^(1/3))= 8* (2^(2/3))= 8*2^(2/3)= 2^(3)*2^(2/3)=2^(11/3). Yes.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or V = cube root of 2048 mph, or V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ miles per hour}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a boxed answer.

This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nNow, substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nSo, V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2. Since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis is the exact value of the wind velocity. If you prefer a decimal approximation:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ miles per hour}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, and P = 4. So k * 2 * (8^3) = 4. 8^3 = 512. So k * 2 * 512 = 4, so k * 1024 = 4, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So k = 1/256.\n\nNow when P=32, A=4, find V such that 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. But 32*64 = 2048. Wait check: 32 * 64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor 2048. 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can write V = 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe simpler: cube root of 2048 = 12.7 approximately. Wait check: Actually, 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) approx = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 1.6 = 12.8. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want an exact answer, it's V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nBut wait, check: 2^(11/3) mph is the exact answer. Alternatively, we can say V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nLet's check: V^3 = (8*2^(2/3))^3 = 512 * 2^2 = 512*4 = 2048, indeed.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity = 2^(11/3) mph or 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, we can also simplify: cube root of 4 is not simplified further. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, one might express it as V = 2^(11/3) mph. So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nLet's see: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 1.6 = 12.8 mph. So answer: about 12.8 mph.\n\nBut maybe we want to be careful: The problem states: \"When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds.\" So the constant of variation is computed as k = 4 / (2 * 8^3) = 4 / (2 * 512) = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for 32 pounds, 4 square feet, we have: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). That is the answer.\n\nThus answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph, or approximately 12.8 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a boxed environment as required by instructions: \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph, or equivalently \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, this becomes:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are told that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb, we need to find V. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\u2003\u2003\u2003(since 2^(11/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3))\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) mph\u2003\u2003or\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate numerical value:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 12.8 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph",
