            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" This means P = k * A * V^3. We are given that when V = 8 mph, A = 2, P = 4. So we find constant k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when P = 32, A = 4. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64) * V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor 2048 = 2^? 2^11 = 2048, because 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But then that's not a nice integer. Let me recalc: Wait, check: 32*64 = 2048, and cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want to simplify further: 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we can simplify: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But is that the intended answer? Let's check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 4 approx 1.5874, so V approx 12.699 mph. But maybe they want an exact expression.\n\nWait, let me check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Now factor 2048 = 2^11. So V = 2^(11/3) mph. That is an acceptable answer. But let me check: Alternatively, we can factor 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can write: V = 8 * cube root(4) mph. But which is the simplest? Possibly \"2^(11/3)\" mph is acceptable.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) mph is the exact expression. But let me check if the problem expects an integer answer: Possibly not.\n\nWait, check: \"The pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So P = k A V^3. When V=8 mph, A=2, P=4, so k = 4/(2*512) = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for A=4 and P=32, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) mph, which is the answer.\n\nNow check: 2^(11/3) mph = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). That's the answer. Alternatively, we can approximate: 2^(2/3) approx 1.5874, so V approx 12.699 mph. But maybe the answer expected is in radical form.\n\nI can express the answer as V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nYes, because cube root of 4 is exactly \u221b4. So answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI can also check: 8\u221b4 mph ~ 8*1.5874 = 12.699 mph, which is the approximate answer.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in the required formatting: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means that\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nfor some constant k.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb, substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nAlternatively, since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\u2003mph",

            "solution": "We are given: The pressure P is proportional to area A and cube of wind velocity V. So P = k * A * V^3. When velocity is 8 mph, pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then we find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Now compute cube root: 2048 = 2^11 = 2048. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want an exact answer. Let me check: 8^3=512, 10^3=1000, 11^3=1331, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197. So it's not an integer. Wait, let me re-check: Actually, let me re-check the calculation: 8^3=512, multiplied by 2 gives 1024, then k=4/1024=1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, so equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64=V^3, 32*64=2048, so V^3=2048. Cube root of 2048 =? Let's factor: 2048=2^11, cube root of 2^11=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8* cube root of 4. So answer is V = 8* cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want a decimal approximation: cube root of 4 ~ 1.5874, so V ~ 8*1.5874=12.699, so approx 12.7 mph. But maybe we want the answer in radical form: V=8\u221b4 mph. But wait, the problem said \"Find the wind velocity\", so answer: 8\u221b4 mph. But maybe they want the exact answer.\n\nWait, but note that the problem states: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" This means P = k A V^3. And then \"When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds.\" So k = 4 / (2*(8^3)) = 4/1024=1/256. Then \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4. So answer.\n\nThus answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph. Alternatively, we can say V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI must output answer in a box. I'll output: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}. But let me check if any simplification is possible: 8\u221b4 is the simplest form. Alternatively, we can write it as 2^(11/3) mph.

            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. That is P = k A V^3 for some constant k. Given that when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So we plug in: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So the formula becomes: P = (A V^3)/256.\n\nNow we need find wind velocity when P=32, A=4. So we have 32 = (4 * V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4 V^3. 32*256 = 8192? Let's check: 32*256 = 8192. Then 8192 = 4 V^3, so V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. Then find V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^? Let's check: 2^11 = 2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) which is not a nice integer. Wait maybe we must have integer result. Let's re-check: Actually, let's recompute: 4 square feet, 32 pounds. Possibly I've made a mistake. Let's check: P = k A V^3, and k = 1/256. Then 32 = (4 V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256 gives 32*256 = 4 V^3, so 8192 = 4 V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So that's not an integer. Let me check the problem statement: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Possibly the answer is 16 mph? Let's check: If V=16 mph, then V^3 = 4096, times area 4 gives 4*4096=16384, divided by 256 equals 64, not 32. So not that.\n\nWait maybe re-read the problem: \"varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V\" means P = k * A * V^3. And we have given: when V=8, A=2, P=4, then constant k = 4/(2*512)= 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4V^3)/256 = V^3/64. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is not a nice number. But maybe they want an answer in radical form: 8\u221b(4)? Because 2^(2/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)= 4^(1/3). So answer = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But is that the simplest answer? Alternatively, we can write as 2^(11/3) mph. Let me check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, but let's check: 2^(11/3) is approximately 2^(3.6667)= 2^3.6667= about 12.7 mph. Let's compute: 2^(11/3) = exp((11/3)*ln2)= exp(3.6667*0.6931)= exp(2.543)= 12.7 mph approx. That seems plausible.\n\nBut maybe we can simplify the constant k differently. Alternatively, maybe I've misinterpreted the phrase \"varies jointly as A and the cube of V\". That means P \u221d A V^3. So constant k is determined by P = k A V^3. Given P=4, A=2, V=8, then k = 4/(2*(8^3)) = 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. So it's correct.\n\nWait, maybe we need to check if the problem is intended to have an integer answer. Perhaps I'm reading the numbers wrong. Let's re-read: \"When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds.\" That gives k = 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256, as computed.\n\nNow for the second scenario: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So then equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4V^3)/256 = V^3/64. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). That is the answer. We can also express as 8\u221b(4) mph. Let me check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2= cube root of 4. So answer: 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI can also approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8*1.5874= 12.699, about 12.7 mph. But the problem might be expecting an exact answer in radical form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express it as cube root of 2048 mph, but that's not simplified. So final answer: 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nLet me check if there's any possibility that the problem intended to use the formula P = k A V^3, but maybe \"varies jointly\" means P = k A V^3. That is standard.\n\nWait, let me check if the constant is computed correctly: For V=8, A=2, P=4, then k = 4/(2*512)=4/1024= 1/256. Yes.\n\nNow for second scenario: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256: 32*256= 4V^3, so V^3= (32*256)/4= (8192)/4=2048, so V = cube root of 2048= cube root of 2^11= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8\u221b(4). So answer: 8\u221b4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: 8\u221b4 mph. We'll box the answer.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph. We'll produce final answer in box.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.

Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are given that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we need to find V. Substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4V\u00b3)/256\n\u2003\u200332 = V\u00b3/64\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4. So compute constant: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2*512 = k*1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow second: when A=4 square feet and P=32 pounds, find V such that: 32 = (1/256)* 4* V^3, i.e. 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11=2048, so cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). But wait, let me check: Actually 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666)= 2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But maybe the answer expects simplified form? Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 2048 is about: cube root of 2048 = about 12.7 mph? Let's check: 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3=12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7=2048.383, so it's almost exactly. But maybe the answer expects: V = cube root (2048) mph = 12.7 mph (approx). But let's see if there is a nice fraction: 2048= 2^11, cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). That's the exact answer. Alternatively, we can simplify: 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, so answer = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of (2^2)= cube root of 4, so answer = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can write: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want decimal approx: 8 * 1.5874= 12.699, so approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWe can check: (8 * cube root of 4)^3 = 512 * 4 = 2048, so that's correct.\n\nI must check: Given: 2*8^3= 2*512=1024, then constant k= 4/1024=1/256, then second: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so yes.\n\nThus answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph = 8 cube root of 4 mph.

Now find wind velocity when A=4 square feet and P=32 pounds. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply: 4/256 = 1/64. So equation becomes: 32 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. But 2048 = 2^11.

Then for second scenario: P=32, A=4, so equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can express it as 8* cube root of 4. But maybe we want to express as approximate value: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, then 8*1.5874 = 12.699, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nBut let me check: 12.7 mph. But is that the intended answer? Let me check: The problem statement: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: wind velocity is cube root of 2048 mph. But maybe they want the answer as 2^(11/3) mph or simplified as 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can check: 8* cube root of 4 mph ~ 8*1.5874 = 12.699 mph, so approx 12.7 mph. But maybe they want an exact expression. Alternatively, we can simplify: 2048 = 8^3 * (2^(2/3))? Let's check: 8^3 = 512, no that's not correct. Actually, 8^3=512, 12.7^3=2050, but not exactly.\n\nWait, let me recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V=8 cube root of 4 mph. But note: 8 cube root of 4 mph is the exact answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can check: V^3=32*64=2048, so V = 2048^(1/3). But 2048=2^11, so V=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, but that is not a nice number. Let me check the arithmetic: Given: P \u221d A * V^3, so P = k A V^3. For first scenario: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k *2*512 = k*1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then second scenario: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. And cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). That is the answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)= (4)^(1/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also express it as: V = 8 * (4^(1/3)) mph. But maybe they want a decimal approximation: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also check: 12.7^3 approximates to 12.7^3 = 2045. So that's consistent.\n\nI can also express answer exactly as: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a final message.

This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003Substitute these into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Solve for k:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003Now, when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the constant part:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\u2003\u2003So the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\u2003\u2003This can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ miles per hour}}.",
