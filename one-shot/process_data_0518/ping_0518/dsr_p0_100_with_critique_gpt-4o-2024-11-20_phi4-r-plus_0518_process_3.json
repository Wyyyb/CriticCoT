            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So equation: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4 pounds. So we can solve for k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 =512. So then 4 = k*2*512 = k *1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Then equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now find cube root of 2048. But 2048= 2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048, yes. So cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3)? Actually 11/3=3.6666. But we want to see if it's a nice number. Wait, check: V^3 = 2048. Cube root of 2048 is not an integer? Let's check: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But maybe we can express as 2^(11/3)? But maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait, is that the simplest form? Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nBut maybe the answer expects a numerical value? Let's check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.6666)= approximate: 2^(3.6666)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(0.6666)= 8*1.5874= 12.699. But problem likely expects answer in terms of radicals. Let me see: 2048= 2^11. Cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8*\u221b(4). So answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, check: is that simplified? Because 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can also express answer as 2^(11/3) mph. But perhaps the problem expects a simplified radical: \"the wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph.\" Let me check if the problem expects a simplified radical or a decimal approximation. The problem is from a typical variation problem in algebra. They might want an answer in terms of radicals. I'll provide: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 4 square feet, 32 pounds, etc. Let me re-read the problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So the equation is P = k A V^3, and k= 4/(2*(8^3))= 4/(2*512)= 4/1024= 1/256. So then for the new values: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3= 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V= cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8\u221b(4). So answer: V= 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWe can check: 8\u221b4 approximates to 8*1.5874= 12.699 mph, which is plausible. So answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWe can also express answer as 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can be further simplified by writing 11/3 as 3 + 2/3:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}",

When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Let's denote constant k such that P = k A V^3. Then given P=4, A=2, V=8. So 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 *512= k *1024. So k=4/1024=1/256. Then new scenario: P=32, A=4, V unknown. So 32= (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32 * 64= 2048. Now solve: V^3=2048, and 2048= 2^11. But cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3)= approximate? Alternatively, note that 2048= 8^3=512? Wait check: 8^3=512, not 2048. Let's recalc: 2^11=2048, cube root: cube root of 2^11=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But maybe the problem expects an answer in terms of radicals. Alternatively, maybe we made error. Let's re-read problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So P = k A V^3. When V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4 lbs. So k = 4/(2*(8^3))=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for A=4, P=32, then equation becomes 32= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, then V= cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further? 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so answer: V=8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe check: 8^3=512, 32^3=32768, no. Let's check: (8 * cube root of 4)^3= 8^3 * (cube root of 4)^3=512*4=2048, yes.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity = 8* cube root of 4 mph. But we can also express as 2^(11/3). Alternatively, we can approximate: cube root of 4 is approx 1.5874, so product is approx 8*1.5874=12.699, so about 12.70 mph. But is that the expected answer? Let me re-read problem: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" It doesn't specify if answer is exact or approximate. Possibly answer: \"Approximately 12.70 mph\" or \"exact answer: 8\u221b4 mph.\"\n\nWait, let me check: 8* cube root of 4 mph. But wait, let me check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity= 8\u221b(4) mph. That is the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 4 = \u221b4 mph.

We'll produce final answer. We'll produce final answer. We'll produce final answer. We'll produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer. We'll produce final answer in text with final answer in \\boxed{}.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1.

Given: when A=2, V=8, P=4, then 4 = k*2*(8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k*2*512 = k*1024, then k = 4/1024 = 1/256.

Now find cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, check: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, so not an integer. Possibly the answer is not a whole number. Wait, check: 2^11 = 2048, cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we can simplify: 8 cube root of 4 mph is the answer. But maybe we can check: (8 cube root of 4)^3 = 8^3 * 4 = 512*4=2048. Yes.\n\nBut maybe the answer is expected to be expressed in simplest radical form: 8\u221b4 mph. Alternatively, we can check if the problem intended to yield integer. Let's recalc: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, then multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4V^3, 32*256 = 8192, then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048, same result.\n\nAlternatively, we can express 2048 as 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can approximate: cube root of 4 is approx 1.5874, so V approx 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx.\n\nAlternatively, we can rationalize: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWe can check: If V=8\u221b4, then V^3 = 8^3 * 4 = 512*4=2048, then pressure = (1/256)*4*2048 = (4*2048)/256 = 8192/256=32, yes.\n\nSo answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. In simplest radical form: 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can also write: V = 4 * cube root of 2 mph? Let's see: 8 cube root of 4 = 8 * (4^(1/3)) = 8 * (2^(2/3)) = 2^(3) *2^(2/3)=2^(11/3) but not simpler. Alternatively, 8 cube root of 4 = 4 * cube root of 2? Check: 4 * cube root of 2 = 4 * 2^(1/3) = 4 * 2^(1/3)= 2^2 *2^(1/3)=2^(7/3), not equal to 2^(11/3). Wait, let me check: 8 cube root of 4= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=2^(11/3) and 4 cube root of 2=2^2 *2^(1/3)=2^(7/3). So they are not equal. So answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can express it as 2^(11/3) mph. So final answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI can also check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 +2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8\u221b(2^2)=8\u221b4 mph.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer with explanation.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nWe are told: When V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, pressure P=4 pounds. So: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k=4/1024=1/256.\n\nNow we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So use formula: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Simplify: (1/256)*4 = 4/256 = 1/64. So we have: 32 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Now find cube root: V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048: 2048= 2^11? Wait, 2^11=2048, yes. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8 * cube root of 4. But we can also simplify: cube root of 2^11=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). But maybe we want a decimal approximate? But maybe the answer is expressed as 2^(11/3). Alternatively, 2^(11/3) equals approx? Let's compute: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4= about 1.5874, so times 8= 12.699, so about 12.7 mph. But the problem likely expects an exact answer in terms of radical form. But the problem statement \"Find the wind velocity\" likely expects an answer in radical form. But the problem is ambiguous: maybe they want the velocity in mph? Let me check: \"When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = cube root of 2048 = 8*2^(2/3) mph. But we can also simplify: 2048= 2^11. So cube root of 2^11= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). But we can also express as 8\u221b4. That is answer.\n\nWait check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, yes.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can say: V = 8*\u221b4 mph.\n\nI can also simplify further: 8\u221b4 mph. But is that simpler? Alternatively, V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nBut let me check: P = k A V^3, with k=1/256, so V^3= 32*64 = 2048, so V= cube root of 2048. Yes.\n\nThus final answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph, or simplified: 8\u221b4 mph. Let me check: 8\u221b4 mph approximately equals 8*1.5874= 12.699 mph.\n\nThus answer: 12.699 mph approx. But probably answer as 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nLet's check: 8\u221b4 mph is the answer.\n\nI can also simplify: 8\u221b4 mph = 8\u221b(2^2)= 8 * 2^(2/3)= 2^(3+2/3)=2^(11/3).\n\nThus answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll provide answer in boxed notation: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.

This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, the pressure P = 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nSubstitute k, A, and P into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant term:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

Given that when V=8 mph, A=2 sq ft, and P=4 lbs, so 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So we have P=32, A=4, so equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. That equals 4/256 * V^3 = (1/64) * V^3. So equation: 32 = V^3 / 64, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: 8 * 2^(2/3). But perhaps we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4.

Let's check: If V=12.7 mph, then V^3 approximates 12.7^3 = 2048. So yes.\n\nBut let's check: 12.7 mph is approximate. But maybe we want exact expression: V = 8*2^(2/3). But check: Actually wait: Let me recalc: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) mph. But 2^(11/3) is not equal to 8 * 2^(2/3)? Let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So yes, that's the same. So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in box: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{12.70 \\text{ mph (approx)}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer in final answer message.

This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2048)\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express this as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSo, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) mph\u2003\u2003or\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate numerical value:\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) \u2248 1.5874, so\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is approximately 12.70 miles per hour.\n\n\\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given: Pressure P varies jointly as area A and cube of wind velocity V, i.e. P = k A V^3. Given that when V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, then P=4 pounds. So then 4 = k * 2 * (8)^3. But (8)^3=512. So k = 4 / (2 *512) = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. So constant k=1/256. Then we want to find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. So we have equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So simplify: 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. So multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, compute 32*64=2048. So V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. Wait, but check: 8 * cube root of 4. But we can also see: cube root of 2048 equals? Let's see: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so not an integer. But maybe we can simplify: 2048 = 8*256, but 8^3=512, no. Let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6667) which is not an integer. Alternatively, we can write it as 2^(11/3)=2^(3 +2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer is V = 8* cube root of 4 mph. But we can also check: 8^3=512, 9^3=729, 10^3=1000, 11^3=1331, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197. So 2048 is between 12^3 and 13^3. So answer is 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3) mph. But wait, let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But that's not a nice integer. Alternatively, maybe we can simplify: 2^(2/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)= cube root of 4, so answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: 8*(cube root of 4) approximates 8*1.5874=12.699. But wait, we can compute: cube root of 2048 = 12.699. But we can also check: 12.699^3 approximates 2048. So answer is 12.699 mph approximately.\n\nBut maybe the answer expects a simplified radical form: 8 cube root of 4 mph or 2^(11/3) mph. But the problem might be expecting a numeric answer in mph. But the problem said \"Find the wind velocity\", so answer: approximately 12.70 mph, or exactly 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nLet's check: Actually, we can also simplify: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*(cube root of 4). So answer: wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, which is about 12.70 mph. Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. But 2048= 2^11, so V=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8 cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nI'll now produce answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in the required format: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.

Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nSince 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nRecognizing that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we can write:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\n\nThis is the exact value; if you need a decimal approximation, 8\u221b4 is approximately 12.70 mph.",
