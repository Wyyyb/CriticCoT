            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have relationship: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant of proportionality. Given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft^2, then P = 4 lbs. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so then 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So now we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So plug in: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. Multiply both sides: 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we want to see if that simplifies to a nice number. Alternatively, maybe we can find a cube factor: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, so not that. But 2^(2/3) is not a nice rational number. Alternatively, we can write answer as 8 * cube root of 4, because 2^(2/3) = (2^2)^(1/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can simplify further? Alternatively, we can solve: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can approximate: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.666...) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 2^(2/3). 2^(2/3) approximates: cube root of 4 approximates 1.5874, so then velocity approximates 12.6992 mph. But the problem likely expects an answer in exact form. But maybe we want to check: if V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. But we can factor: 2048 = 8*256, but that's not cube. Alternatively, 2048= 16 * 128, not cube. Alternatively, 2048 = 64 * 32, not cube. Alternatively, 2048 = 2^11, so answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or 8 * cube root of 4 mph. I'd check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the simplest exact expression.\n\nBut maybe we want to check: Actually, let me recalc: P = k A V^3, k=1/256, then P= (1/256)*A*V^3, so for P=32, A=4, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, then V^3=32*64=2048, yes. So answer: V= cube root of 2048 mph. Which is 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut then is that simplified? Let's see: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3)=2^3 *2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, 2^(11/3)= (2^(1/3))^11, but that's not simpler. Alternatively, express as 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nMaybe we want to check if 2^(2/3) can be expressed as cube root of 4. Yes. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph. But then maybe the answer is \"12.70 mph\" if approximate value is needed. But the problem statement is likely from a textbook that expects an answer in terms of radicals. I'll check: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" It doesn't specify an approximate answer. The answer can be left in radical form. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nBut wait, check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8*(cube root of 4). Alternatively, we can write: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. So final answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWe can also note that 2^(2/3) = (2^2)^(1/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also check: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.587, so then 8*1.587= 12.696 mph. So answer: approx 12.70 mph.\n\nI will now produce answer. But I'll produce step-by-step explanation.\n\nStep 1: Write formula: P = k A V^3.\nStep 2: Substitute given values: 4 = k (2)(8^3)= k (2)(512)= k (1024). So k = 4/1024= 1/256.\nStep 3: Now use second scenario: 32 = (1/256)(4)(V^3)= (4/256) V^3= (1/64) V^3.\nStep 4: Multiply both sides by 64: V^3= 32*64= 2048.\nStep 5: Solve for V: V= cube root of 2048= cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: V=8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph. But I'll also mention approximate value: approx 12.70 mph. But I'll produce answer in box. I'll produce final answer as \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation. We'll produce answer in a final message. We'll produce final answer in a box. We'll produce answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce final answer. We'll produce answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003We are told that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we need to find V.\n\u2003Substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003Simplify the constants:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64,\n\u2003so the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003Multiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048.\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048.\n\u2003Notice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3).\n\u2003We can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4.\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}.\n\nFor an approximate value, note that \u221b4 \u2248 1.587, so\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.70 mph.",

When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe are given: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Using given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, P = 4. So, 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then, find V when A=4 and P=32. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 * V^3. 32*256 = 8192, so 8192 = 4 * V^3, so V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. We know 2048 = 2^11 because 2^11 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) which is not a nice integer. Alternatively, maybe we can compute cube root of 2048 exactly: 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 2048? Wait, check: 12.7^3 approximates 2048? Let's do: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 2048? Let me check: Actually, cube root of 2048 = 12.7? Wait, let's compute: cube root of 2048 = e^(1/3 * ln(2048)). ln(2048) = ln(2^11)= 11 ln2 approx 11*0.693=7.623, divided by 3 is 2.541, exponent is e^(2.541)=12.7. But maybe the answer is in radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = (2^(1/3))^11. That is not simpler. Let's try to see if we can express as a radical: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = cube root of (8*256)= cube root of 8 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of 256 = 2* cube root of (2^8)= 2* 2^(8/3)=2^(1+8/3)=2^(11/3). So that's the answer. But maybe we want a decimal approximation: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4 = about 1.5874. So product is about 8*1.5874=12.699. So velocity is approximately 12.7 mph. But wait, check: V^3=2048, cube root of 2048 exactly equals 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7= about 2048. So yes.\n\nBut let me re-check the multiplication: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32= (4/256) V^3 = (1/64) V^3, then V^3=32*64=2048, yes.\n\nSo answer: V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph, approx 12.7 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify: 2048=8*256, so cube root of 8=2, cube root of 256= cube root of (2^8)= 2^(8/3), so V=2^(1+8/3)=2^(11/3). That is the answer.\n\nI want to check: is the answer supposed to be in mph? Yes, because the given velocity was in mph.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can now produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}} or approx 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce answer in text: \"The wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce answer in final answer: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer with reasoning.\n\nI'll produce answer with step by step. We'll produce answer.\n\nI'll produce answer with final answer in boxed.\n\nI'll produce answer in text: \"We have the equation P = k A V^3. Using the given values, we find k = 1/256.

So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = 4/256 * V^3 = (1/64)* V^3.

Then for A=4, P=32, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, which gives V^3 = (32*256)/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, numerical approximate: V \u2248 12.70 mph.\n\nI want to double-check: If V=8 mph, then P= (1/256)*2*512= (1/256)*1024=4, which checks out.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: V \u2248 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll answer with explanation.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in final message with \\boxed{...}. We'll produce answer with \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}} or \\boxed{8\\cdot 2^{2/3} \\text{ mph}} or approx \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nSubstitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express this as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThis is the exact form of the wind velocity. To find an approximate value, note that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, which is approximately 1.5874. Thus:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nSo, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\n\\boxed{12.7\\ \\text{miles per hour}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means that P = k * A * V^3 for some constant k.\n\nGiven: when V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, P=4 pounds. So plug: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. But 8^3=512, so 4= k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow second part: find V when A=4, P=32. So equation: 32 = k * 4 * V^3 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Now compute cube root of 2048. Let's see: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, so it's between. Wait, I can simplify: 2048=2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). That is not a nice integer. Alternatively, maybe I'm mistaken: Let's re-check: k= 4/ (2*512)= 4/1024= 1/256, then equation: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32= (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so V^3= 32*64=2048, cube root of 2048 is 12.7 approximately. But maybe I need to check: 12.7^3 is around 2048? Let's compute: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7*12.7, but that's approximate. Alternatively, we can simplify: 2048= 2^11, cube root of 2^11= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4, so answer is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe the problem expects that answer. Alternatively, if we simplify further: 4=2^2, so cube root of 4= 2^(2/3). So answer: V= 8*2^(2/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so answer is: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait, we might check if we can simplify to a rational number. Let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer. But maybe the problem expects a decimal approximated value: 8 * cube root of 4 mph, cube root of 4 approximates 1.5874, so product approx 12.699 mph, which is about 12.7 mph.\n\nBut maybe I can re-check the given: \"When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds.\" That gives k=1/256. Then for A=4, P=32, then equation: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4 mph. So answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nHowever, maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= (4)^(1/3)? Actually, cube root of 4 is 4^(1/3). So answer: V= 8*(4)^(1/3) mph. Alternatively, we can write as V= 2^(3+2/3)=2^(11/3) mph.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects a numerical answer. So answer: V= approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI can check: 12.7 mph cubed is about 2048. So answer: V= 12.70 mph approximately.\n\nI must include final answer in a boxed expression: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph. But I'll check if the problem expects a numeric answer: \"Find the wind velocity\" means answer in mph. So I'll give answer as: V= 8*(cube root of 4) mph or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.

Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have equation: P = k * A * V^3. Given data: when V=8, A=2, P=4, so k = P / (A * V^3) = 4/(2*8^3) = 4/(2*512) = 4/(1024) = 1/256. So equation is: P = (1/256)*A*V^3.\n\nNow second scenario: A=4, P=32, so then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so simplify: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor 2048: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can find approximate value: 2^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, then multiplied by 8 gives about 12.7 mph. But likely the answer should be expressed as 8*2^(2/3) mph exactly, or maybe cube root of 2048 mph.\n\nLet's check: 8^3 = 512, 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so cube root of 2048 is between 12 and 13. But it's exactly 2^(11/3). But the question might be answered as \"the wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph\" or \"the wind velocity is cube root of 2048 mph.\" But maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = cube root of (8) * cube root of (256) = 2 * cube root of (256) but that doesn't simplify nicely. Let's check: 256=2^8, so cube root of 2^8 = 2^(8/3) = 2^(2+2/3) = 4*2^(2/3). So then 2 * 4*2^(2/3) = 8*2^(2/3) mph. So answer: 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nLet me check: 8*2^(2/3) mph = 8*(2^(2/3)) mph = approximate value: 2^(2/3)= approx 1.5874, times 8 equals 12.699 mph approx. So answer: about 12.70 mph.\n\nWait check: if we plug in: 32 = (1/256)*4*(12.699)^3. Let's check: (12.699)^3 = approx 2048, then product equals (4/256)*2048 = (1/64)*2048= 32 exactly. So it's consistent.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is cube root of 2048 mph, which simplifies to 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nI can also express answer as: V = cube root of (32*64) = cube root of (2048) mph.\n\nI'll express answer as: V = cube root of 2048 mph = 8 * cube root of 4 mph?
