            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So P = k A V^3. We are given: when velocity=8 mph, sail area=2 ft^2, pressure=4 pounds. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k*2*512 = k*1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then second scenario: A=4, P=32. Then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we want a simpler form maybe: 2^(11/3) = 8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can try to see if 2048 is a perfect cube. 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so not perfect cube. Alternatively, express as: V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). But maybe we want an approximate value: cube root of 2048 = e^( (11/3)*ln2 ) = e^( (11/3)*0.693 ) = e^(2.543) = 12.72 mph approx. But wait: Let me check: 12.7^3 = 12.7^3? Let's check: 12.7^3= about 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 = (12.7*12.7=161.29, times 12.7 equals 2048.383) So yes approx. Alternatively, maybe the answer expects \"12.7 mph\" or \"2^(11/3) mph\". But wait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 12.7 mph approx. But let me check: Actually, 8 mph is given. But then if the area doubles and pressure quadruples, then the wind velocity? Let's check: P= k A V^3. For the first scenario: 4 = k*2*512, k=4/1024=1/256. For second scenario: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. 2048 is not a perfect cube, but it's 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3)= 2^(9/3+2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity = 8 * cube root of 4? Wait, 2^(2/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)= 4^(1/3) so answer: 8* cube root of 4 mph. But cube root of 4 is not simpler than 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can express as: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, but that's not simpler than 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express as: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2, which is cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But that is not exactly \"nice\" number. But maybe we want an approximate decimal. Let me check: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699 mph approx. So answer: approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nWait, but the problem expects a result. Let me check: The problem says: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = cube root of (32*64) = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, but let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll check: 2^(2/3) approximates 1.5874, so product is 8*1.5874=12.6992 mph. So answer: about 12.7 mph. So final answer: 12.7 mph approx.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in boxed result: \\boxed{12.7} mph approx. But I'll also produce exact form: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nWait, let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 is the same as 8 * 2^(2/3). But I want to check: 8*2^(2/3)= 2^3*2^(2/3)= 2^(11/3). So answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. I'll produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}. I'll produce answer: \"The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce answer in text: \"Since P = k A V^3, we find k = 4/(2*8^3)=4/1024=1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8* cube root of 4 mph. Approximately 12.7 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given data:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, we have\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, this becomes\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the value of k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are given that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, the equation becomes\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nStep 4. Approximate the value:\nCalculating the cube root of 4 gives approximately 1.5874, so\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(or approximately 12.7 mph).",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So equation: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Then when V = 8 mph, A = 2, P = 4. So we solve for k: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. Note that 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then the equation is P = (1/256) * A * V^3. Then find wind velocity when P=32, A=4, so: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, or 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64) * V^3. So then multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. So then V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute cube root: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048, so cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. But we can also compute approximate value: cube root of 2048 = 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 approximates 2048. But let's see: Actually, 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 approximates? Alternatively, we can compute exactly: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But the answer might be given in radical form: V = 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 4 is not an integer. Alternatively, we can note: 2048 = 8^3 * 2? Let's check: 8^3=512, not 2048. Wait, let's check: Actually, 8^3=512, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so V is between 12 and 13. Let's do: 12.7^3 approximates 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048.023, so V approx 12.7 mph. But maybe we can simplify the expression: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph, or V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as cube root of 2048 mph. But then we can simplify further: 8 * cube root of 4 mph is the simplest radical form.\n\nWait, let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3)= 2^(9/3)*2^(2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, cube root of 4 mph times 8 mph, that's the answer.\n\nWe can also check: (8*2^(2/3))^3 = 8^3 * 2^2 = 512 * 4 = 2048, so it's correct.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express as: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}} mph, or equivalently, \\boxed{8 \\cdot 2^{2/3}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.

Given: When velocity is 8 mph, pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. So we have 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. Then k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Next, we need to find wind velocity when pressure is 32 pounds and sail area is 4 square feet. So we have: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. Simplify: 4/256 = 1/64. So equation becomes: 32 = (1/64)* V^3, multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11, since 2^11 = 2048. So cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so V ~ 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But we can also express exactly as 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can check: 8 * 2^(2/3) mph is the answer. But perhaps we can simplify further: 8 * 2^(2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 2^(11/3). So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But wait, let me check: if V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). So answer is: V = 2^(11/3) mph, which is about 12.70 mph.\n\nWe can also express as: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. So final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ mph}}. Alternatively, we can say about 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box. We'll produce final answer: \\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ mph}}. We'll produce final answer: \\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ mph}}. I'll produce final answer in text.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb, substitute these values:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Solve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the coefficient:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\u2003\u2003So, 32 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048, hence:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph. If you prefer a decimal approximation:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ mph}}",

Given: when velocity is 8 mph and area is 2 square feet, pressure is 4 pounds. So substitute: 4 = k * 2 * (8)^3. Evaluate: 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. Then k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So constant is 1/256.\n\nNow question: find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. So use: P = k * A * V^3, so 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3. Solve: 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now find cube root: cube root of 2048. Let's factor: 2048 = 2^? Actually 2^11 = 2048. So V^3 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But likely they want a numerical answer. But 2^(11/3) is not an integer. Let's check: 2^(11/3) = (2^(1/3))^11. But we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = 2 * cube root of 256 = 2 * 6.3496? Wait, check: Actually, we can check: 8^3 =512, 10^3=1000, so it's between 10 and 11. But let's solve: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6667)= approximate value. Let's compute: 2^(11/3) = exp((11/3)*ln2) = exp(3.66667*0.6931)= exp(2.540)= 12.7 approx. Let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7^3 = 2047.9 approx. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph. But maybe we can express answer exactly in radical form: V = 8 * cube root of 4. Wait, let's check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(9/3+2/3)=2^3*2^(2/3)=8*(2^(2/3)). But 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, so answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as cube root of 2048. Let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nLet me check: 8*(cube root of 4) mph is the exact answer. But wait: Actually, 2^(2/3)= cube root of (2^2)= cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But we can also simplify: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8 * (2^(2/3)). That is the answer. Alternatively, we can write: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nBut let me double-check: 4 * (1/256) = 4/256 = 1/64, so equation: 32 = (1/64)* V^3, then V^3 = 32*64=2048. So V= cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8 *2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nHowever, wait, check: Actually, 8*(cube root of 4) = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. So answer is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI must check: \"When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds.\" That gives k = 4/(2*8^3) = 4/(2*512)= 4/1024= 1/256. So then when A=4, P=32, so 32= (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32= (4/256)* V^3= (1/64)* V^3 => V^3=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8*cuberoot(4). So answer: V=8*cuberoot(4) mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI must provide answer in a neat step by step explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

So plug in: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024.

Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate value, note that \u221b4 is about 1.587, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given that pressure P varies jointly as area A and cube of wind's velocity V. So relation: P = k A V^3, where k is constant. Given: when velocity=8 mph, area=2, pressure=4 pounds. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when area=4, pressure=32. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Now cube root: cube root of 2048? Let's factor: 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But is that simplified? Alternatively, we can find approximate value: cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. But we can also simplify: 2^(11/3) is not an integer. Let's check: Actually, wait: 2^(11/3) = (2^(3*3+2/3)? Actually 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 12.7 mph approximately. But is there a nicer fraction? Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8*(cube root of 4). Alternatively, maybe the answer is expressed as 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, check: 8^3=512, 4^3=64, product: 512*64=32768, not 2048. Let's recompute: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4V^3, then 32*256 = 8192, then 4V^3=8192, so V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, which is indeed 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3). That is the answer.\n\nWe can also compute approximate: 2^(11/3) = exp((11/3)*ln2) = exp(3.6666*0.693) = exp(2.539) = 12.67 mph approximately. But let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66667) = 2^3 * 2^(0.66667) = 8 * (cube root of 2^2) = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approx. 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also check: if V = 12.7 mph, then V^3 approx. 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048 approx. So answer is consistent.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}, or more exact: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box. We'll produce answer with final answer in the box.\n\nI'll produce final answer with explanation: The constant k is computed from the given values: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k*1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then substitute into new equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 8192/4 = 2048, and then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) mph.

This can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\u2003\u20038\u00b3 = 512, so:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Solve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 256:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192, so:\n\u2003\u20038192 = 4V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Divide both sides by 4:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192 / 4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\u2003\u2003This can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is 2^(11/3) miles per hour, or equivalently, 8\u221b4 mph. In decimal form, this is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThe final answer is:\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}.",
