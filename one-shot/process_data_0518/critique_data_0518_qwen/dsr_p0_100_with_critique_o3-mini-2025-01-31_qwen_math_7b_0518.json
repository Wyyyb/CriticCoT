Key Concepts and Correct Approach:\n\u2022 The problem describes a joint variation: pressure P varies directly with the sail\u2019s area A and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V. So, the formula is P = kAV\u00b3, where k is the constant of proportionality.\n\u2022 The correct approach is to first determine k using the given condition (P = 4, A = 2, V = 8) and then use the found value of k to solve for V in a second scenario (P = 32, A = 4).\n\nStep 2. Checking the Student's Solution:\n1. They correctly set up the relationship as P = kAV\u00b3.\n2. Substituting P = 4, A = 2, and V = 8 gives:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.\n3. They correctly computed 8\u00b3 = 512, so the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024,\n\u2003\u2003leading to k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n4.

Here is where the error occurs: they claimed that the cube root of 2048 is 12. In fact, 12\u00b3 = 1728, not 2048.\n\nStep 3. Correcting the Error and Providing the Correct Solution:\nTo find V from V\u00b3 = 2048, note that:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9.\nTaking the cube root gives:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2048^(1/3) = (2\u00b9\u00b9)^(1/3) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\nThus, the wind velocity is V = 8\u00b72^(2/3) miles per hour.\nFor an approximate value, note that 2^(2/3) is roughly 1.587, so V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.7 mph.\n\nFinal Answer: \n\\boxed{8 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}}}\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",

Key Concepts and Correct Approach:\n\u2022 The problem describes a variation where the pressure P varies jointly as the sail area A and the cube of the velocity V, so we write P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2022 We first determine the constant k using the given condition P = 4, A = 2, V = 8.\n\u2022 Then, using the constant k, we find V when P = 32 and A = 4.\n\nStep 2.

The error occurs in the final step:\n\u2003\u2003The student took the cube root of 2048 and incorrectly concluded V = 16.\n\u2003\u2003Since V\u00b3 = 2048 and 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\u2003\u2003Numerically, 2^(2/3) is approximately 1.587, so V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.696 mph, not 16 mph.\n\nStep 3. Correct Solution:\n1. Begin with the joint variation formula:\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n2.

Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048.\n5. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2048) = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\nThus, the correct wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\cdot2^{\\frac{2}{3}}} miles per hour.\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",

The student then used the second condition (P = 32 lb, A = 4 ft\u00b2) to set up:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3, which simplifies to 32 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n5. Multiplying both sides by 64 gives:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048.\n6. The error arises in the final cube root step. The student wrote V = \u221b2048 = 16, but:\n\u2003\u200316\u00b3 = 4096, not 2048. In reality, 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so the cube root is V = 2^(11/3). Numerically, 2^(11/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) which is approximately 12.7.\n\nStep 3: Correct Solution and Final Answer\nFrom V\u00b3 = 2048, we take the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048 = 2^(11/3).\nThus, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{11/3}}\u2003(mph)\nor approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",

Simplifying (1/256)\u00b74 = 1/64, they obtain:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64)\u00b7V\u00b3, so V\u00b3 = 32\u00b764 = 2048.\n5. The error occurs in the final step. The student takes the cube root of 2048 and concludes V = 12. However:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048 = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3).\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8\u00b72^(2/3), this value is approximately 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70.\n\u2003\u2003Thus, V is approximately 12.70 mph\u2014not exactly 12.\n\nStep 3. Correct Solution and Final Answer\nStarting from V\u00b3 = 2048, we find:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048 = 2^(11/3) = 8\u00b72^(2/3).\nThis value can be left in exact form as 8\u00b7\u221b(4) or 8\u00b72^(2/3), or approximated to approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph} \\quad (\\text{approximately } 12.70 \\text{ mph})}\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",

Checking Each Step of the Student's Work:\n1. The student writes the correct equation: P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n2. Substituting P = 4, A = 2, V = 8 gives 4 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3. Since 8\u00b3 = 512, the equation becomes 4 = k \u00b7 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. This step is correct.\n3. For the new condition, the student substituted P = 32, A = 4, and obtained 32 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.

The error appears when taking the cube root: The student concludes that V = \u221b2048 equals 16. In fact, 16\u00b3 equals 4096, not 2048. Since 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, we have V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3). This is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\nStep 3. Correct Solution:\n1.

Analyzing the Student's Work:\n\u2022 The student correctly sets up the equation as P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2022 Substituting the first set (P = 4, A = 2, V = 8), the student writes 4 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.

Checking the Student's Steps  \n1. The student correctly set up the equation: P = k A V\u00b3.  \n2. Substitution of P = 4, A = 2, V = 8 gives:  \n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.  \n3.

Since the pressure varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can use this information to find the value of \\( k \\). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo find \\( k \\), we divide both sides by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. Substituting \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{4}{256} \\cdot V^3 = \\frac{1}{64} \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nWe can simplify \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) miles per hour.",

        "critique": "Step 1: Key Concepts and Correct Approach\n\u2022 The pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V, so the relation is P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2022 We use the given condition (P = 4 when A = 2 and V = 8) to determine the constant k.\n\u2022 Then we substitute the second condition (P = 32 and A = 4) into the formula to solve for V.\n\nStep 2: Checking Each Step in the Student's Solution\n1. The student correctly set up the equation as P = kAV\u00b3.\n2. Substituting P = 4, A = 2, and V = 8, the student wrote:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, this became 4 = k \u00b7 1024.\n3. Dividing both sides by 1024, the student found k = 4/1024 = 1/256. This part is correct.\n4. For the second condition, the student substituted P = 32, A = 4, and k = 1/256 into the formula:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplifying gives 32 = (4/256) V\u00b3 = (1/64) V\u00b3.\n5. Multiplying both sides by 64, the student obtained V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048. This is also correct.\n6. The student then took the cube root of both sides and stated:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048 = 16.\n\u2003\u2003Here is the error. In fact, 16\u00b3 = 4096, not 2048.\n\nStep 3: Correcting the Error and Providing the Correct Solution\nWe have V\u00b3 = 2048. Notice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 because 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048. Taking the cube root, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3).\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221b(2\u00b2) = 8\u221b4.\nThus, the correct wind velocity is V = 8\u221b4 miles per hour.\n\nFinal Answer:\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\n\nConclusion: wrong [END]",
