        "critique": "1) Key Concepts and Correct Approach:  \nThe problem states that pressure (P) varies jointly as area (A) and the cube of velocity (V). Thus,  \nP = k A V\u00b3,  \nwhere k is a constant of proportionality. One uses the given data (P, A, and V) to find k, then uses that k with the new values of P and A to solve for V.\n\n2) Checking the Student's Steps:  \n\u2022 They correctly state P = k A V\u00b3.  \n\u2022 Substituting P = 4, A = 2, V = 8 into 4 = k \u00d7 2 \u00d7 8\u00b3 gives  \n  4 = k \u00d7 2 \u00d7 512 = k \u00d7 1024, so k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.  \n\u2022 Next, for P = 32 and A = 4, they set up 32 = (1/256) \u00d7 4 \u00d7 V\u00b3 = (4/256) V\u00b3 = (1/64) V\u00b3.  \n\u2022 Then 32 = (1/64) V\u00b3 implies V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048.  \n\u2022 The student\u2019s error: they concluded that 2048 = 8\u00b3, but in fact 8\u00b3 = 512.
