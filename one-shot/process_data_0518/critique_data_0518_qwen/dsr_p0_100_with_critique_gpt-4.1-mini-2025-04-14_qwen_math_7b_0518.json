Checking each step of the student's solution:\n\n- **Step 1:** Writing the joint variation formula:\n  \\[\n  P = k A V^3\n  \\]\n  This is correct.\n\n- **Step 2:** Substituting \\( P=4 \\), \\( A=2 \\), and \\( V=8 \\):\n  \\[\n  4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3\n  \\]\n  Correct substitution.\n\n- **Step 3:** Calculating \\( 8^3 = 512 \\):\n  Correct.\n\n- **Step 4:** Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 = k \\cdot 1024\n  \\]\n  Correct.\n\n- **Step 5:** Solving for \\( k \\):\n  \\[\n  k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256}\n  \\]\n  Correct.\n\n- **Step 6:** Using the formula with \\( P=32 \\), \\( A=4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\):\n  \\[\n  32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3\n  \\]\n  Correct substitution.\n\n- **Step 7:** Simplifying the right side:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64}\n  \\]\n  So,\n  \\[\n  32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3\n  \\]\n  Correct.\n\n- **Step 8:** Solving for \\( V^3 \\):\n  \\[\n  V^3 = 32 \\times 64 = 2048\n  \\]\n  Correct.\n\n- **Step 9:** Taking cube root:\n  \\[\n  V = \\sqrt[3]{2048}\n  \\]\n\n  Let's verify \\( \\sqrt[3]{2048} \\):\n\n  - \\( 12^3 = 1728 \\)\n  - \\( 13^3 = 2197 \\)\n\n  So \\( \\sqrt[3]{2048} \\) is between 12 and 13.\n\n  The student claims \\( \\sqrt[3]{2048} = 16 \\), which is incorrect because:\n  \\[\n  16^3 = 4096 \\neq 2048\n  \\]\n\n  Actually,\n  \\[\n  2048 = 2^{11}\n  \\]\n  So,\n  \\[\n  V = \\sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^{11/3} = 2^{3 + 2/3} = 2^3 \\times 2^{2/3} = 8 \\times 2^{2/3}\n  \\]\n\n  Numerically,\n  \\[\n  2^{2/3} = \\sqrt[3]{2^2} = \\sqrt[3]{4} \\approx 1.5874\n  \\]\n\n  So,\n  \\[\n  V \\approx 8 \\times 1.5874 = 12.7 \\text{ (approx.)}\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Correct solution:\n\nThe only error is in the cube root calculation.\n\n**Correct final step:**\n\n\\[\nV^3 = 2048\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = \\sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^{11/3} = 8 \\times \\sqrt[3]{4} \\approx 8 \\times 1.5874 = 12.7\n\\]\n\nThus, the wind velocity is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12.7 \\text{ miles per hour}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe student's approach and calculations are correct except for the final cube root evaluation.

Key Mathematical Concepts and Correct Approach\n\n- The problem states that pressure \\( P \\) varies jointly as the area \\( A \\) and the cube of velocity \\( V \\). This means:\n  \\[\n  P = k A V^3\n  \\]\n  where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\n- Given values:\n  \\[\n  P = 4, \\quad A = 2, \\quad V = 8\n  \\]\n  Use these to find \\( k \\).\n\n- Then, given:\n  \\[\n  P = 32, \\quad A = 4\n  \\]\n  find \\( V \\).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Checking Each Step of the Student's Solution\n\n- **Step 1:** Writing the equation \\( P = k A V^3 \\) \u2014 **Correct**.\n\n- **Step 2:** Substituting \\( P=4, A=2, V=8 \\):\n  \\[\n  4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3\n  \\]\n  Calculate \\( 8^3 = 512 \\), so:\n  \\[\n  4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 = k \\cdot 1024\n  \\]\n  Solve for \\( k \\):\n  \\[\n  k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256}\n  \\]\n  \u2014 **Correct**.\n\n- **Step 3:** Using \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\), \\( P=32 \\), \\( A=4 \\):\n  \\[\n  32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3\n  \\]\n  Simplify:\n  \\[\n  32 = \\frac{4 V^3}{256} = \\frac{V^3}{64}\n  \\]\n  Multiply both sides by 64:\n  \\[\n  V^3 = 32 \\times 64 = 2048\n  \\]\n  \u2014 **Correct**.\n\n- **Step 4:** Taking cube root:\n  \\[\n  V = \\sqrt[3]{2048}\n  \\]\n  The student claims \\( 2048 = 8^3 \\), so \\( V=8 \\).\n\n  Let's verify \\( 8^3 \\):\n  \\[\n  8^3 = 512\n  \\]\n  But \\( 2048 \\neq 512 \\).\n\n  Actually:\n  \\[\n  2048 = 2^{11} \\quad \\text{(since } 2^{10} = 1024, 2^{11} = 2048)\n  \\]\n\n  Cube root of \\( 2048 = \\sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^{11/3} = 2^{3 + 2/3} = 2^3 \\times 2^{2/3} = 8 \\times 2^{2/3} \\).\n\n  Since \\( 2^{2/3} = \\sqrt[3]{2^2} = \\sqrt[3]{4} \\approx 1.5874 \\),\n\n  So:\n  \\[\n  V \\approx 8 \\times 1.5874 = 12.7 \\text{ (approx.)}\n  \\]\n\n  The student's conclusion that \\( V = 8 \\) is **incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Correct Solution\n\nWe have:\n\\[\nV^3 = 2048\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\( V \\):\n\\[\nV = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = \\sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^{11/3} = 2^{3 + 2/3} = 8 \\times 2^{2/3}\n\\]\n\nNumerically:\n\\[\n2^{2/3} = \\sqrt[3]{4} \\approx 1.5874\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\\[\nV \\approx 8 \\times 1.5874 = 12.7\n\\]\n\nSo the wind velocity is approximately \\( \\boxed{12.7} \\) miles per hour.\n\n---\n\n### **Final answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12.7}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe student correctly set up the problem and found \\( k \\), but made an error in evaluating the cube root of 2048. The correct wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph, **not** 8.\n\n**Conclusion: wrong [END]**",

            "solution": "To solve the problem, we start by expressing the relationship between the pressure \\( P \\), the area \\( A \\), and the wind's velocity \\( V \\) mathematically. Since the pressure varies jointly as the area and the cube of the wind's velocity, we can write:\n\n\\[ P = kA V^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality. We are given that when the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. We can substitute these values into the equation to find \\( k \\):\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 8^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 8^3 = 512 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply 2 by 512:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4 = k \\cdot 1024 \\]\n\nTo find \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1024:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256} \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( k \\), we can use it to find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. We substitute \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = kA V^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( V^3 \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 64:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 32 \\cdot 64 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 32 \\cdot 64 \\):\n\n\\[ 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\]\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n\\[ V^3 = 2048 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = \\sqrt[3]{2048} \\]\n\nSince \\( 2048 = 8^3 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ V = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds is \\(\\boxed{8}\\) miles per hour.",
