The correct simplification is:\n\\[\nV = 8 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{4}\n\\]\nThe student does not correctly compute \\( \\sqrt[3]{4} \\), and their final answer of \\( \\boxed{8} \\) is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Correct solution\nFrom the previous steps, we know:\n\\[\nV^3 = 2048\n\\]\nTaking the cube root:\n\\[\nV = \\sqrt[3]{2048} = \\sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^3 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 8 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{4}\n\\]\nThus, the exact value of \\( V \\) is:\n\\[\nV = 8 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{4}\n\\]\nApproximating \\( \\sqrt[3]{4} \\) numerically (using a calculator):\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{4} \\approx 1.587\n\\]\nSo:\n\\[\nV \\approx 8 \\cdot 1.587 = 12.696\n\\]\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[\nV \\approx 12.70\n\\]\nThe correct wind velocity is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12.70 \\, \\text{miles per hour}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe student's solution is **wrong** because they made an error in simplifying \\( 2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\) and incorrectly concluded that \\( V = 8 \\). The correct wind velocity is approximately \\( \\boxed{12.70} \\). [END]",

Substituting the new values of \\( P \\) and \\( A \\) to solve for \\( V \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Checking Each Step of the Student's Solution\n\n#### Step 2.1: Finding \\( k \\)\nThe student correctly substitutes the given values \\( P = 4 \\), \\( A = 2 \\), and \\( V = 8 \\) into the equation \\( P = k A V^3 \\):\n\n\\[\n4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8^3\n\\]\n\nThe student calculates \\( 8^3 = 512 \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n4 = k \\cdot 2 \\cdot 512\n\\]\n\nNext, the student multiplies \\( 2 \\cdot 512 = 1024 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n4 = k \\cdot 1024\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 1024 gives:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{4}{1024} = \\frac{1}{256}\n\\]\n\nThis step is correct.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 2.2: Solving for \\( V \\)\nThe student substitutes \\( P = 32 \\), \\( A = 4 \\), and \\( k = \\frac{1}{256} \\) into the equation \\( P = k A V^3 \\):\n\n\\[\n32 = \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 \\cdot V^3\n\\]\n\nThe student calculates \\( \\frac{1}{256} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{256} = \\frac{1}{64} \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n32 = \\frac{1}{64} V^3\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 64 gives:\n\n\\[\nV^3 = 32 \\cdot 64\n\\]\n\nThe student calculates \\( 32 \\cdot 64 = 2048 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nV^3 = 2048\n\\]\n\nThis step is correct.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 2.3: Taking the Cube Root of \\( 2048 \\)\nThe student takes the cube root of \\( 2048 \\). Since \\( 2048 = 2^{11} \\), the cube root is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{2048} = \\sqrt[3]{2^{11}} = 2^{\\frac{11}{3}}\n\\]\n\nThe student simplifies this as:\n\n\\[\n2^{\\frac{11}{3}} = 2^3 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 8 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{4}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the student makes a critical error in the final simplification. The cube root of \\( 2048 \\) is not \\( 16 \\). Instead, it is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{2048} = 2^{\\frac{11}{3}} = 16 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe student incorrectly concludes that \\( V = 16 \\), but this is not accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Correct Solution\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we take the cube root of \\( 2048 \\):\n\n\\[\nV = \\sqrt[3]{2048}.\n\\]\n\nUsing a calculator or approximation, we find:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{2048} \\approx 12.7.\n\\]\n\nThus, the wind velocity is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12.7 \\, \\text{miles per hour}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe student's solution is **incorrect** because of an error in simplifying the cube root of \\( 2048 \\). The correct wind velocity is approximately \\( \\boxed{12.7} \\, \\text{miles per hour}. \\)\n\n**Conclusion: wrong [END]**",
