            "solution": "We are given the problem statement: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" We'll denote relationship: P = k * A * V^3. Then using given initial conditions: when V=8, A=2, P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then for new condition: P=32, A=4, V unknown. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)? Let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 2048 = approximately 12.7 mph? Wait, let's check: 12.7^3 = 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 approximates: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = (12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7 = 2048.383) so it's about 12.7 mph. But let's check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, which is about 1.5874, times 8 gives about 12.7 mph. So answer: wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, or cube root of 2048 mph, or about 12.7 mph.\n\nLet's check consistency: P = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3) approximately equals (4/256)*12.7^3 = (1/64)*12.7^3, and 12.7^3 approximates 2048, so equals 2048/64 = 32 pounds. So answer is correct.\n\nThus final answer: V = cube root of 2048, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in boxed answer: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ miles per hour}}.\n\nBut I'll check if the answer is exactly: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Let's see: 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, so answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph. But then 8 cube root of 4 = 8 * cube root of 4, which is exactly the same as 2^(3) * 2^(2/3) = 2^(11/3) mph. But the simplest form: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. But maybe I'll give the approximate answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ miles per hour (approximately)}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer as \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer in final answer message.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = 1024k\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003We are given P = 32 pounds and A = 4 ft\u00b2. Substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThus, the exact wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) mph\n\nFor an approximate value, note that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, which is approximately 1.5874. Therefore:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{12.7 \\text{ miles per hour (approximately)}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nWe are given: When velocity is 8 mph, pressure is 4 pounds on a sail of 2 square feet. So, we plug: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So, equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve: Multiply: (1/256)*4 = 4/256 = 1/64. So equation becomes: 32 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Now find cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11 = 2048. But cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) which is not a nice integer. Wait maybe I need to check: Actually, 8 mph times 8 mph times 8 mph? Let's check: 8 mph gives 8^3=512, so pressure= (1/256)*2*512= (1/256)*1024 = 4. That works. For new problem: Pressure = 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048. Cube root of 2048 =? Let's compute: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so it's between 12 and 13. Alternatively, factor 2048= 2^11, so cube root= 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666)=8*2^(2/3). 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so product approx 8*1.5874= 12.699. So answer approximately 12.70 mph. But let me check: Actually, maybe the answer is exactly 8*(2^(2/3)) mph. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer in terms of radicals. But since 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8*(cube root of 4) mph. But wait, check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of (2^2)= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8*cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: 8*cube root of 4 = 8* cube root of 4 mph, which is the answer. Alternatively, if we want approximate, 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, let's check: We have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 2048, and cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. But maybe we want the answer as 8* cube root of 4 mph, or maybe simplified as 2^(11/3). Let's see: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8*cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut let me check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut wait, 8*(cube root of 4) is not 12.7 mph? Let's compute: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, multiplied by 8 equals 12.6992 mph approx. So answer: Approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also represent answer in terms of radical: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer step by step.\n\nStep 1: Write equation: P = k * A * V^3.\nStep 2: Use given: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3, so solve for k.\n8^3=512, so 4 = k*2*512 = 1024k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\nStep 3: For new problem: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4=32*64=2048.\nStep 4: V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4 mph.\nStep 5: Answer: V=8 cube root of 4 mph approx 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in boxed answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant factor:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate numerical value:\n\u2003\u2003\u221b4 \u2248 1.5874, so V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}",

So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow second scenario: Pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds, with unknown velocity V. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's see: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11 = 2048. So V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we want a decimal approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approximately. But maybe we want an exact answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph. Alternatively, we can say V = 8 * (4^(1/3)) mph. But wait, let's check: 4^3 = 64, no, 4^(1/3) is the cube root of 4, not 2^(2/3). Let's re-check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2^2 = 4^(1/3)? Actually, wait: 2^(2/3) = (2^2)^(1/3) = 4^(1/3). So yes, it's same.\n\nSo answer: The wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph or about 12.70 mph. Let me check: 8^3 = 512, times 2 gives 1024, times constant 1/256 equals 4. Yes.\n\nWait check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, then V^3 = 32 * 256 / 4 = 32 * 64 = 2048, so cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph. So answer: Approximately 12.7 mph. We can also express answer as 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. That is the exact answer.\n\nWe can also simplify: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI can now produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.

Use the constant k to find the unknown wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the right side:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64, so:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So relation: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, P = 4. So then: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So then: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then question: find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. So use: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3, so 8192 = 4*V^3. So V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we want a numeric answer. Alternatively, we can compute cube root of 2048: cube root of 2048 is about? Let's see: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197. So it's between 12 and 13. But can we simplify? Actually, 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But the answer in exact form is 8 * cube root of 4? Wait, 2^(2/3) = cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But if we want approximate value, then cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so V approx = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph, which is about 12.7 mph. Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph. But let's check: 12.7^3 is about 2048. So answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can check: P = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3). 12.7^3 approx equals 2048, then P approx equals (1/256)*4*2048 = (1/256)*8192 = 32. So answer is consistent.\n\nI can also see if there's a simpler answer: The equation becomes: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI can also check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph. But let me double-check: Actually 2^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, so 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box with explanation.

When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Let's denote the constant of variation as k. Then we have: P = k * A * V^3. Given that when A=2, V=8, P=4, then 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024k, then k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then for second scenario: P=32, A=4, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve: 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor 2048: 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But that is not a nice number. Wait check: Actually 2^11 = 2048. But perhaps we can simplify: V = cube root(2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: 2^(2/3) = approximately 2^(0.6667) approx 1.5874, so V approx = 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But maybe the problem expects an answer in terms of radicals or fractional exponents. Wait check: We have P = k A V^3. Then k = 1/256. So P = (A V^3)/256. For the second scenario, 32 = (4 V^3)/256, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (8192)/4 = 2048, so V = cube root(2048) = 2^(11/3). That is the answer. Possibly can be simplified further: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can express 2^(2/3) as the cube root of 4. Because cube root of 4 is 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait check: 2^(11/3) = (2^3)*(2^(2/3)) = 8*(2^(2/3)). And 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph. But wait check: Actually 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) which is about 12.7 mph. Let me check: 8 * cube root of 4, cube root of 4 is about 1.587, so 8*1.587=12.696, so yes.\n\nThus answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph or V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait maybe we can simplify: Actually, let me re-check: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k*1024, so k= 4/1024 = 1/256. So then second: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. And 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3). So answer: 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWe can also express as cube root of 2048 mph. So answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph. But the simplest form is 2^(11/3) mph. But then maybe they want a numerical value? Possibly answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThe problem: \"Find the wind velocity\" likely expects answer in mph. So answer: about 12.7 mph. But wait, check: 8 mph gave pressure 4 pounds, and now with bigger area and bigger pressure, the wind velocity is larger than 8 mph. But our computed value is 12.7 mph, which is plausible.\n\nWait, let me re-check: With area 2, velocity 8 mph, pressure is 4. With area 4, velocity 12.7 mph, pressure is 32. So the ratio: Pressure is proportional to area times cube of velocity. So doubling area quadruples pressure if velocity constant, but here pressure increased by factor 8 (from 4 to 32) so that is 2^3, so velocity increased by factor 2, so velocity should be 16 mph if area doubled and pressure increased by factor 8. But wait, check: Actually, if you double area, then pressure doubles if velocity is constant. But here pressure increased by factor 8, so that is 2 times more than doubling area. Wait, let me recalc: For area 2, velocity 8 mph, pressure= 4. For area 4, if velocity were 8 mph, then pressure would be 8 (because doubling area doubles pressure). But we need 32, which is 4 times more than 8, so velocity must be increased by factor cube root of 4, which is about 1.587. So then velocity becomes 8*1.587=12.7 mph. That matches our calculation.\n\nWait, I want to double-check: If A=4, then pressure = k * 4 * V^3, and we want that to equal 32. We know k=1/256, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, V = cube root of 2048, which is approximately 12.7 mph. Yes.\n\nThus answer: 2^(11/3) mph or 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, in decimal approximate: 12.7 mph.\n\nI can now produce final answer. I'll produce final answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3}\\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.

Substituting the given values: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3).

Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) mph\u2003\u2003or\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nIf you need a decimal approximation:\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) \u2248 1.587, so V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\nFinal Answer:\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{11/3}\\text{ mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe are given: \"P varies jointly as A and V^3.\" So we have: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: When V=8 mph and A=2, P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). But 8^3=512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we are asked: when A=4 and P=32, find V. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11. Wait, 2^11 = 2048, so V^3 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666) but can be simplified further: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can find approximate value: 2^(2/3)= (cube root of 4) approximates 1.5874, so V approx= 8*1.5874= 12.699. But maybe the answer expects an exact form: 2^(11/3) mph, or \"8*2^(2/3) mph\", or maybe \"2^(11/3) mph\".\n\nBut perhaps we can check: 8*2^(2/3) mph. Let's check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, so answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can also write V = cube root (2048) mph. But perhaps we can simplify: 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) mph. But that is the simplest exact form. But perhaps we can rationalize it further: V = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3) mph. So answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want a decimal approximation: 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, but check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, yes.\n\nWe can also check: 2048 = 8^3? But 8^3=512, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13 mph. So answer: about 12.7 mph.\n\nBut wait, I need to double-check: The problem statement \"varies jointly as A and V^3\" means P = k A V^3. Yes.\n\nDouble-check: P=4 when A=2, V=8. Then 4 = k*2*512, so k=4/1024=1/256. Then for new situation: P=32, A=4, so 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4=32*64=2048. So V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: 8*2^(2/3) mph or cube root of 2048 mph. That is the answer.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\text{ mph} \\text{ or approximately } 12.7 \\text{ mph.}}\n\nI'll now produce answer with final answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box.

We'll produce answer: The wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer.Since the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V, we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb, substitute these into the equation:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are given A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb, and we need to find V. Substitute the known values into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nSimplify the right side:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nSince 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (because 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is exactly 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) mph. In decimal form, this is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{8 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\text{ mph} \\text{ (approximately 12.7 mph)}}",

            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. That is, P = k * A * V^3. We are given: when V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, then P=4 pounds. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So 4= k *2*512 = k *1024. Then k=4/1024 = 1/256. So the constant is 1/256.\n\nNow we want: find wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So we have: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve for V. Multiply both sides: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor 2048: 2048= 2^11. So V=2^(11/3)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we want decimal approximations. Alternatively, note that 2^(11/3)= (2^(3+2/3)) = 8 * 2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 2^2= 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe they want an exact answer in radical form. Alternatively, note that the problem might be intended to produce a rational number. Wait, check: Actually, we had: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, and 2048=2^11. So V= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). That is the exact answer. But maybe they want a decimal approximation: cube root of 4 is approx 1.5874, so V approx 8*1.5874=12.699. But likely the answer is 8* cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps the problem expects answer: The wind velocity is 8*(cube root of 4) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph. However, maybe we want to simplify further. Alternatively, note that 2^(2/3)= (4)^(1/3). So answer: V = 8*(4)^(1/3) mph. Alternatively, we can check: 8*(cube root of 4)=8*1.5874=12.699. So answer: approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nDouble-check: if V=8 mph, then P= (1/256)*2*(512)= (1/256)*1024=4, so that's correct. And if V=8*(cube root of 4) mph, then V^3= 8^3*(cube root of 4)^3=512*4=2048, and then P= (1/256)*4*2048= (4/256)*2048= (1/64)*2048=32, correct.\n\nThus answer: V=8*(cube root of 4) mph, or V= 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.

Find k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, the pressure P = 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nCalculate 8\u00b3:\n\u2003\u20038\u00b3 = 512\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So that means: P = k * A * V^3 for some constant k. Given: When velocity is 8 mph, area is 2 square feet, pressure is 4 pounds. So: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. Then k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. So now find wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. So we have: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11. So cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want a simpler expression. Alternatively, maybe we can solve: V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root(2048) = 12.7? Wait check: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197. So it's between 12 and 13, but we want an exact answer. But note that 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) which can be written as 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). But maybe we want to express in radical form. Alternatively, we can express as 8\u221b(4) because 2^(2/3) = \u221b(2^2) = \u221b4. So answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 12.7 mph approx. But the problem likely expects an exact answer in radical form.\n\nWait check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph, or V = 8\u221b4 mph. But let me check: (8\u221b4)^3 = 512 * 4 = 2048. So yes.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also express as: V = 8\u221b4 mph. But note the problem might be expecting the answer in miles per hour.

So: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024k. So k= 4/1024 = 1/256. Now second scenario: pressure P=32, area A=4, find velocity V. So: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve: 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, then V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11= 2048. So V = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4.

Compute 8^3 =512, then 2*512=1024, so equation is 4=1024k, then k=4/1024 = 1/256. Then find V when P=32, A=4, and k=1/256. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32= (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64= V^3. 32*64=2048, so V^3=2048. Then find cube root: cube root of 2048 =? Let's factor 2048: 2048 = 2^? 2^11=2048, since 2^11=2048.

But maybe we want to simplify further: Alternatively, note that V^3= 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = cube root of 8 * cube root of 256=2 * cube root of 256. But 256=2^8, so cube root of 256=2^(8/3)=2^(2.6666) not simpler. Let's recalc: V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3).

But wait, maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= 2^(9/3)*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8* cube root of 4. But the answer might be expressed as cube root of 2048 miles per hour.

Let's check: 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7= 12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7= 2048.38 approx, so yes.\n\nWait, but I want to check: 4 square feet, 32 pounds, and k=1/256, so equation: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3 => V^3= (32*256)/4= (32*256)/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3)= approx 12.7 mph.\n\nI want to check: Actually, wait, re-read question: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k A V^3. Given: When velocity is 8 mph, pressure on sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. That yields k=4/(2*8^3)=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So equation: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). That is the exact value.\n\nWe can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)= (4)^(1/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut wait, is that the simplest? Alternatively, we can write V= 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nSo answer: V= 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can double-check: If V=12.7 mph, then V^3 approx=12.7^3 approx=2048, then P= (1/256)*4*2048= (4*2048)/256=8192/256=32, so yes.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph. But wait, let me recalc: 8*2^(2/3)=8*(2^(2/3)). But 2^(2/3)= approximately 1.5874, so product equals 8*1.5874=12.699 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph} \\approx 12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a neat answer. I'll produce answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is about 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer in \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer in \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.

I'll produce answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a neat final answer message.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = 1024k\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are asked to find V when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply (1/256) by 4:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(9/3) \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nIf you wish to approximate the value, note that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, which is approximately 1.5874. Thus:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nSo, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph} \\quad \\text{(approximately } 12.7 \\text{ mph)}}",

            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. So P = k * A * V^3. Given when velocity=8 mph, area=2, pressure=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4 = k*2*512= k*1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now then find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so simplify: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64= V^3, so 2048= V^3, then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048: 2048= 2^11, cube root: V= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 2^3 *2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. But wait check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3) = 8 *2^(2/3). But is that the simplest? Alternatively, maybe we want to find a rational approximate value: cube root of 2048 approx? Actually, 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, so answer is between 8 and 16 mph. But let me compute: cube root of 2048= cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.66667)= 2^3.66667= around 12.7 mph? Wait recalc: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.66667)= 2^(3 + 0.66667)= 8*2^(0.66667). And 2^(0.66667) ~ 1.6 (since 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4 ~ 1.5874). So answer approx 8*1.5874= 12.699 mph. But we can leave answer as 2^(11/3) mph or as 8 cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: 8* cube root of 4 mph. But wait, is that exactly? Let's check: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8* 4^(1/3)= 8* (2^(2/3))= 8*2^(2/3)= 2^3*2^(2/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 2^(11/3). So that's the answer.\n\nHowever, check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.66667)= approximate value 12.7 mph. But let me check: using the equation: P= (1/256)*A*V^3, and plug A=4, then 32= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, and cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3). So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer accordingly.\n\nI'll now produce answer in text: \"We are given that P = k A V^3.

When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have the relationship: P = k * A * V^3. Given that when V = 8 mph and A=2, then P = 4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4= k*2*512 = k*1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we need to find V when A=4 and P=32. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor 2048: 2^11 = 2048. So cube root: V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want a decimal approximate? Alternatively, we can simplify: 2^(2/3) is about 2^(0.66667) approx 1.5874. So V approx = 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph, approximately 12.7 mph. But maybe the answer is expressed in radical form: 8 * cube root(4) mph? Let's check: 2^(2/3) = cube root(2^2) = cube root(4).

Let's check: (8 cube root 4)^3 = 512 * 4 = 2048, yes.\n\nWait, but we can also do: V = cube root of (32*64) = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nLet's check: 8 cube root of 4 mph is approximately 8*1.5874= 12.699 mph.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nLet's denote that P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: P=4, A=2, V=8 mph. Then 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when P=32, A=4. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now cube root of 2048 equals? Factor 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)? Actually 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: V = 8 * cube root of 4? Wait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3+2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But then 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2^2, which is the cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2048 approx 12.7 mph. But let's see if we can simplify: 2048 = 2^11. The cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, which is about 12.7 mph. Alternatively, we can solve exactly: V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, check: Actually 8 mph gives 4 pounds. Then 4 square feet at 12.7 mph gives pressure: P = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3). Let's check approximate: 12.7^3 approx 2048, so P= (4/256)*2048= (1/64)*2048=32. So that's consistent.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is cube root of 2048 mph, which is 8*2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also express it as: V = 8 * (cube root of 4) mph. Let's see: Actually cube root of 4 = 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nWait, let's check: 8*(cube root of 4) is 8*(cube root of 4) mph. But 8 * cube root of 4 is 8*(approx 1.5874) = 12.699 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph, or \\boxed{8\\cdot2^{2/3}} mph, or approximately \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll provide final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. We'll check: When velocity is 8 mph, pressure is 4 pounds. For 4 sq ft, 32 pounds, then V= cube root of 2048 mph. But I'll produce answer as: V= cube root of 2048 mph = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}. We'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given data:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nSubstitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Find V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) mph\n\nThis is the exact answer. For an approximate value, note that 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" We'll denote constant as k. So formula: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V=8, A=2, P=4, so 4 = k*2*(8^3). 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 *512 = k *1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then second scenario: P=32, A=4, unknown velocity V. Then 32 = k *4 * V^3, but k=1/256, so 32= (1/256)*4 * V^3 = (4/256) V^3 = (1/64) V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V= cube root of 2048. We can compute: 2048= 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So V = 8 * cube root of 4. But wait, check: 8* cube root of 4 = approximate 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph. But let me see if that's correct. Let's check: Actually, we need to check: V^3 = 2048, cube root of 2048 is 12.699? Wait, compute: cube root of 2048 = 12.699? Let's check: 12.7^3 is 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7 = 12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7 = 2048.383, yes. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph. But maybe we want an exact answer in radical form: V = 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can express as cube root of 2048 exactly: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 +2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V=8*2^(2/3) mph. That is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to express in radical form: V=8* cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want a decimal approximation: approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nLet's check: if V=12.70 mph, then V^3 = 12.70^3 approx= 12.70^3= 12.7*12.7*12.7= 2048, then pressure P= k * A * V^3= (1/256)*4*2048= (4*2048)/256= 8192/256= 32, which is correct.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with reasoning.

Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nSubstitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given that \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3. We are told that when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So then k = 4/(2*512) = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we want: find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So we have: 32 = k * 4 * V^3, where k=1/256. So equation becomes: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64=2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now solve for V: V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048: 2048=2^11, since 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3). But if we want a decimal, we can compute: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = about 12.7 mph? Wait, let's check: 2^(3)=8, 2^(4)=16, so cube root of 2048 is between 12 and 13. Let's compute: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But maybe we want an exact expression. But perhaps the answer is in radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= (2^(2/3))*2^(3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But then maybe not simpler. Alternatively, 2048= 8*256, so cube root of 2048= cube root of (8*256)= cube root of 8 * cube root of 256= 2 * cube root of 256. But cube root of 256= cube root of (2^8)=2^(8/3). So that equals 2^(11/3) as before.\n\nWe can also find approximate value: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.6667)= about 12.7 mph, but let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 2048. So answer: V = 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, check: Actually 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3) and 2^(2/3)= about 1.5874, so product=8*1.5874= 12.6992 mph approx.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer: The wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer in box. Let me produce answer with steps.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}. But let me check: Wait, check: 2 mph? Let's check: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3, so k= 4/(2*512)=4/1024=0.00390625, then 32 = 0.00390625 * 4 * V^3, so V^3=32/(0.015625)=32/0.015625=2048, V = cube root of 2048=12.7 mph approx. Yes.\n\nI'll produce final answer. We'll produce answer with the reasoning: Pressure P= k A V^3, find k, then solve.\n\nI'll produce answer with final answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}. We'll produce final answer in text: The wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003So, 4 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Thus, k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003We are given that when A = 4 ft\u00b2, P = 32 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003So, 32 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the right side:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048.\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048.\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\u2003\u2003This can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nStep 4. Approximate the value:\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.6992 mph.\n\u2003\u2003Rounded to one decimal place, V \u2248 12.7 mph.\n\nThus, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\n\\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have P = k A V^3, where k is constant. Then given: when velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. So 4 = k * 2 * (8)^3. 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So we have 32 = k * 4 * V^3, where k = 1/256. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (V^3)/64, so then V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Let's see: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But maybe we want to simplify to radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph, but that's not a nice number. Alternatively, maybe we can compute approximate value: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666) = approx 12.7 mph. But let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 2048? Let's recalc: 12.7^3 is around 12.7^3 = 2048. So answer: V = cube root of 2048, which is exactly 2^(11/3) mph. But perhaps we want to simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. So answer: wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph. That is the exact answer. But wait: Let's check: 8 * cube root of 4, cube root of 4 is about 1.587, then product is about 12.7 mph, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph? Let's check: cube root of 4 = 4^(1/3) is not 1.587, but wait, 4^(1/3) ~ 1.587. So product 8*1.587 = 12.696 mph. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 factorization: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3). That is the simplest form.\n\nWe can also solve: V^3 = 2048, then V = 2048^(1/3). But I think the answer is: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8 * 4^(1/3). But that is not simpler than 2^(11/3). Alternatively, note that 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer in final answer form.\n\nI'll produce answer in final message: \"The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\" I'll produce answer in final message.

Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nSubstitute A = 4, P = 32, and k = 1/256 into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (V\u00b3) / 64\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

Given: when velocity V=8 mph, area A=2, pressure P=4. So we plug: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then for new condition: pressure P=32, area A=4, and unknown velocity V. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. Multiply: (1/256)*4 = 4/256 = 1/64. So equation becomes: 32 = (1/64)* V^3, then multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. So then V = cube root of 2048. Let's see: 2048 = 2^? Actually 2048 = 2^11.

Let's check if maybe we can get a simplified radical expression: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so answer becomes: 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want approximate value: 8* (cube root of 4) approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so product is about 12.699, so approximately 12.7 mph. But likely answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 8^3=512, so k=4/1024=1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, then 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32= (4/256) V^3 = (1/64) V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, and V= cube root of 2048. We can factor: 2048=2^11, so V=2^(11/3)=2^3 *2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8* cube root of 4 miles per hour. But wait, check: cube root of 4 is not simplified to a rational number, so answer is in radical form. Alternatively, if we want an approximate value: about 12.7 mph.\n\nLet's check: 12.7 mph, cube velocity: 12.7^3= about 2048, yes.\n\nThus answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So P = k * A * V^3. Given when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4. So we find constant: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now question: find wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Now factor 2048. 2048 = 2^11, since 2^11=2048. Then cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3) mph. But perhaps simpler: V = cube root of 2048 mph. But 2^(11/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can say V = 8*(2^(2/3)). But maybe we can simplify further. Let's see: 2^(2/3) is not an integer. So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can say V = 8*\u221b(4) mph. Wait, check: 2^(2/3)= (2^(1/3))^2. So answer: V = 8*(2^(1/3))^2 mph, which is equivalent to 8\u221b(4) mph. Alternatively, we can write as: V = 8\u221b(4) mph. But is that acceptable? Alternatively, we can compute approximate: 2^(1/3) approx 1.26, so then V approx 8*1.587 = 12.7 mph approx. Wait check: 2^(2/3)= (cube root of 2)^2 approx 1.2599^2=1.587. Then V approx 8*1.587=12.696 mph approx. But the problem likely expects an exact answer in radical form: V = 8 * \u221b(4) mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph. Let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.666...)= 2^3 *2^(2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer is same. We can also say: V = 8*\u221b4 mph.\n\nLet's check: 8^3=512, 4*512=2048, yes.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nI can also check: 8 mph with pressure 4 pounds, 4 square feet with 32 pounds, wind velocity is increased by factor? Because pressure is proportional to area and cube of velocity. So if area doubles (from 2 to 4) then pressure doubles (4 to 8) if velocity constant, but actually pressure quadrupled (from 4 to 32) so velocity must be increased by factor? Let's check: Pressure = k A V^3. If we double area, then pressure becomes 2*(k A V^3)=2P. But actual pressure is 32 vs 4, which is factor 8. So velocity factor must be cube root of 4, i.e. V factor must be cube root of 4, so new velocity = 8*(cube root of 4) mph. That is consistent with our answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait, 8*(cube root of 4) mph is equal to 8*4^(1/3) mph. But earlier we got 8*2^(2/3) mph, and note 4^(1/3)= 2^(2/3). So it's the same. So answer: V = 8*\u221b4 mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * \u221b4 mph. But check: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.587, so velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll provide final answer in the required format: \"The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph\" or \"8 * 2^(2/3) mph\".\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce final answer with step-by-step explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer. We'll produce answer in the required format.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k.\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, the pressure is P = 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant to find the new wind velocity.\nWe are given a new situation where A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds. Substitute these into the equation with our found k:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nSo,\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V.\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Thus,\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4 (because 4 = 2\u00b2), we can also write:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}.",

When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have formula: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Then given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, then P = 4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8)^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we want: when pressure P = 32, area A = 4, find V. So we have: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64) * V^3. So then multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3. 32 * 64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can write V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. But maybe it's simpler: 2048 = 8^3? Let's check: 8^3 = 512, not 2048. So not. Alternatively, we can compute cube root of 2048: Let V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 approximates 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 2048? Actually, let's do: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7, but I'll check: 12.7^2 = 161.29, multiplied by 12.7 = 2048.383, so yes. But it's probably expected as exact expression in terms of radicals: V = \u221b2048 = 2^(11/3) mph, or simplified further.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express in radical form: 2^(2/3) = \u221b(2^2) = \u221b4, so answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nBut wait, check: 8\u221b4 mph is the answer. Alternatively, we can compute: 2^(11/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. But maybe we want to express as \"8\u221b4 mph\" mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can also simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8 * 256) = cube root of 8 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of (2^8) = 2 * 2^(8/3) = 2^(1 + 8/3) = 2^(11/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. That is same.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) ~ 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699, so roughly 12.7 mph. So answer: wind velocity is about 12.7 mph. But the question likely expects: V = \u221b2048 mph = 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, check: 8\u221b4 mph: 8\u221b4 mph = 8 * \u221b4 mph, and \u221b4 is about 1.587, product is 12.696, yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can express answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now check: Pressure P = k * A * V^3, k = 1/256, then for A=4, V=8\u221b4 mph, V^3 = (8\u221b4)^3 = 8^3 * 4 = 512 * 4 = 2048, then P = (1/256)*4*2048 = (4/256)*2048 = (1/64)*2048 = 32, correct.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, or equivalently, 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now provide answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now provide final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003Now, when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the constant term:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64.\n\u2003\u2003So, 32 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048.\n\u2003\u2003Now, take the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048.\n\nStep 3. Simplify \u221b2048:\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3).\n\u2003\u2003This can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\u2003\u2003Alternatively, since 2^(2/3) = \u221b(2\u00b2) = \u221b4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}\n\nThis is the exact answer, and approximately, 8\u221b4 \u2248 12.7 mph.",

            "solution": "We are given problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have: \"varies jointly as A and V^3\", so P = k A V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4, so 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find velocity for P=32, A=4, so 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^? Let's check: 2^11=2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But maybe we want a decimal? Alternatively, factor: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8* 2^(2/3). But maybe simpler is to write as 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we want to simplify further: cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approximately? Let's check: 12.7^3 approximates 12.7^3 = 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 12.7*161.29= 2048? Actually, 12.7^3 is about 2048. So answer is approximately 12.7 mph. But let me check: Actually, cube root of 2048 exactly equals 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048.0? Let me compute precisely: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7 = 161.29, then multiply by 12.7 yields 2048.383? Actually, let's compute: 12.7 * 161.29 = 2048.383. Actually, let me recompute exactly: 2048^(1/3) equals? Actually, I'll compute: cube root of 2048. 2^11=2048, so cube root = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, so product equals 8*1.5874=12.6992 mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph. So answer: wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or about 12.70 mph.\n\nWait, but let me re-check: P = k A V^3, k=1/256, so for new condition: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer is exactly that.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nWe can also express as: V= 8*(cube root of 4)? Wait, let me check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4, so V= 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But wait, 8 * cube root of 4 is not equal to 8*2^(2/3) because cube root of 4=2^(2/3) indeed. So answer: wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph is 8 * 1.5874= 12.6992 mph, same as previous.\n\nThus answer: V= 8*(cube root of 4) mph, which is exactly 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer in text.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}, or \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{12.70 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = 1024k\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds.\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nSimplify the constant terms:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\nNotice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\nThis can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nStep 4. Approximate the value:\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) \u2248 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.6992 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph} \\text{ (approximately } 12.70 \\text{ mph)}}",

            "solution": "We are given: The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. That means P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. Solve for k: k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we are asked: find wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. That means: 32 = k * 4 * V^3. Use k = 1/256. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64=2048? Let's check: 32*64= 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor: 2048= 2^? Actually 2^11=2048? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3)? But we can also compute: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256)? Not exactly. Let's simplify: 2048 = 8*256 = 8*256. But 256 is 4^4? No, 256=2^8. So 2048=2^3 *2^8=2^11. So cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want a decimal? But maybe we want exact expression: V= 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.66667)= about 12.7 mph. But let's check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.6667)= approximate: 2^3=8, then 2^(0.6667)= about 1.5874, product approx 12.699. So answer is V \u2248 12.7 mph.\n\nHowever, the problem likely expects an exact answer in radical form: cube root of 2048, which can be simplified: 2048= 64*32? Wait, check: 64 * 32=2048. But cube root of 64 is 4, so then cube root of 32 is cube root of 32= 2^(5/3)? That doesn't simplify well.\n\nWait, check: 64 is 4^3? Actually 4^3=64, so cube root of 64=4. So 2048=64*32, cube root = cube root of 64 * cube root of 32 = 4 * cube root of 32. But cube root of 32= cube root of (2^5)= 2^(5/3). So answer is 4*2^(5/3) mph. But note: 2^(5/3)= 2^(1+2/3)= 2*2^(2/3). So that equals 4*2*2^(2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So either answer is V= 8*2^(2/3) mph, which is equivalent to 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWe can check: 8 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * (approx 1.5874)= 12.699. So answer is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nHowever, I'll double-check: k= 1/256, then equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64= 2048, cube root is 2^(11/3) mph. So answer.\n\nThus final answer: wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or about 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in boxed answer. But careful: the problem might want an exact answer in radical form.\n\nI can write: V = cube root of 2048 mph = 8 * cube root of 4 mph? Let's check: 8* cube root of 4 mph? Wait, 8* cube root of 4= 8*(4^(1/3))= 8* (2^(2/3))= 8*2^(2/3)= 2^(3)*2^(2/3)=2^(11/3). Yes.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or V = cube root of 2048 mph, or V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ miles per hour}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a boxed answer.

This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nNow, substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nSo, V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2. Since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis is the exact value of the wind velocity. If you prefer a decimal approximation:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ miles per hour}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, and P = 4. So k * 2 * (8^3) = 4. 8^3 = 512. So k * 2 * 512 = 4, so k * 1024 = 4, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So k = 1/256.\n\nNow when P=32, A=4, find V such that 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. But 32*64 = 2048. Wait check: 32 * 64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor 2048. 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can write V = 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe simpler: cube root of 2048 = 12.7 approximately. Wait check: Actually, 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) approx = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 1.6 = 12.8. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want an exact answer, it's V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nBut wait, check: 2^(11/3) mph is the exact answer. Alternatively, we can say V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nLet's check: V^3 = (8*2^(2/3))^3 = 512 * 2^2 = 512*4 = 2048, indeed.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity = 2^(11/3) mph or 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, we can also simplify: cube root of 4 is not simplified further. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, one might express it as V = 2^(11/3) mph. So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nLet's see: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 1.6 = 12.8 mph. So answer: about 12.8 mph.\n\nBut maybe we want to be careful: The problem states: \"When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds.\" So the constant of variation is computed as k = 4 / (2 * 8^3) = 4 / (2 * 512) = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for 32 pounds, 4 square feet, we have: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). That is the answer.\n\nThus answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph, or approximately 12.8 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a boxed environment as required by instructions: \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph, or equivalently \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, this becomes:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are told that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb, we need to find V. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\u2003\u2003\u2003(since 2^(11/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3))\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) mph\u2003\u2003or\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate numerical value:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 12.8 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have relationship: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant of proportionality. Given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft^2, then P = 4 lbs. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so then 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So now we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So plug in: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. Multiply both sides: 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we want to see if that simplifies to a nice number. Alternatively, maybe we can find a cube factor: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, so not that. But 2^(2/3) is not a nice rational number. Alternatively, we can write answer as 8 * cube root of 4, because 2^(2/3) = (2^2)^(1/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can simplify further? Alternatively, we can solve: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can approximate: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.666...) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 2^(2/3). 2^(2/3) approximates: cube root of 4 approximates 1.5874, so then velocity approximates 12.6992 mph. But the problem likely expects an answer in exact form. But maybe we want to check: if V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. But we can factor: 2048 = 8*256, but that's not cube. Alternatively, 2048= 16 * 128, not cube. Alternatively, 2048 = 64 * 32, not cube. Alternatively, 2048 = 2^11, so answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or 8 * cube root of 4 mph. I'd check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the simplest exact expression.\n\nBut maybe we want to check: Actually, let me recalc: P = k A V^3, k=1/256, then P= (1/256)*A*V^3, so for P=32, A=4, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, then V^3=32*64=2048, yes. So answer: V= cube root of 2048 mph. Which is 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut then is that simplified? Let's see: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3)=2^3 *2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, 2^(11/3)= (2^(1/3))^11, but that's not simpler. Alternatively, express as 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nMaybe we want to check if 2^(2/3) can be expressed as cube root of 4. Yes. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph. But then maybe the answer is \"12.70 mph\" if approximate value is needed. But the problem statement is likely from a textbook that expects an answer in terms of radicals. I'll check: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" It doesn't specify an approximate answer. The answer can be left in radical form. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nBut wait, check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8*(cube root of 4). Alternatively, we can write: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. So final answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWe can also note that 2^(2/3) = (2^2)^(1/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also check: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.587, so then 8*1.587= 12.696 mph. So answer: approx 12.70 mph.\n\nI will now produce answer. But I'll produce step-by-step explanation.\n\nStep 1: Write formula: P = k A V^3.\nStep 2: Substitute given values: 4 = k (2)(8^3)= k (2)(512)= k (1024). So k = 4/1024= 1/256.\nStep 3: Now use second scenario: 32 = (1/256)(4)(V^3)= (4/256) V^3= (1/64) V^3.\nStep 4: Multiply both sides by 64: V^3= 32*64= 2048.\nStep 5: Solve for V: V= cube root of 2048= cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: V=8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.

            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe are given: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Using given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, P = 4. So, 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then, find V when A=4 and P=32. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 * V^3. 32*256 = 8192, so 8192 = 4 * V^3, so V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. We know 2048 = 2^11 because 2^11 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) which is not a nice integer. Alternatively, maybe we can compute cube root of 2048 exactly: 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 2048? Wait, check: 12.7^3 approximates 2048? Let's do: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 2048? Let me check: Actually, cube root of 2048 = 12.7? Wait, let's compute: cube root of 2048 = e^(1/3 * ln(2048)). ln(2048) = ln(2^11)= 11 ln2 approx 11*0.693=7.623, divided by 3 is 2.541, exponent is e^(2.541)=12.7. But maybe the answer is in radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = (2^(1/3))^11. That is not simpler. Let's try to see if we can express as a radical: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = cube root of (8*256)= cube root of 8 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of 256 = 2* cube root of (2^8)= 2* 2^(8/3)=2^(1+8/3)=2^(11/3). So that's the answer. But maybe we want a decimal approximation: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4 = about 1.5874. So product is about 8*1.5874=12.699. So velocity is approximately 12.7 mph. But wait, check: V^3=2048, cube root of 2048 exactly equals 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7= about 2048. So yes.\n\nBut let me re-check the multiplication: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32= (4/256) V^3 = (1/64) V^3, then V^3=32*64=2048, yes.\n\nSo answer: V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph, approx 12.7 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify: 2048=8*256, so cube root of 8=2, cube root of 256= cube root of (2^8)= 2^(8/3), so V=2^(1+8/3)=2^(11/3). That is the answer.\n\nI want to check: is the answer supposed to be in mph? Yes, because the given velocity was in mph.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can now produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}} or approx 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce answer in text: \"The wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce answer in final answer: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer with reasoning.\n\nI'll produce answer with step by step. We'll produce answer.\n\nI'll produce answer with final answer in boxed.\n\nI'll produce answer in text: \"We have the equation P = k A V^3. Using the given values, we find k = 1/256. Then substitute P=32, A=4 to get 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4= 2048, so V = cube root of 2048, which is 2^(11/3) mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce answer in final answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 256 to eliminate the fraction:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 256:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192\n\nNow, solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u20034 \u00b7 V\u00b3 = 8192\u2003\u27f9\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192 / 4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Find V by taking the cube root of 2048:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nFor a decimal approximation, note that:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, which is approximately 1.5874,\n\u2003\u2003Thus, V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ mph (approximately 12.7 mph)}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have relation: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when velocity is 8 mph and area is 2 square feet, pressure is 4 pounds. So 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = 4/256 * V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Solve cube root: 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). But we might try to simplify further: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But perhaps the answer expects a decimal approx? Alternatively, find approximate cube root: cube root of 2048 ~ 12.7 mph? Let's check: 12.7^3 is approx 2048. Possibly answer: V = 12.7 mph approx. But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But that's not a nice number. Alternatively, we can find exact cube root: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, times 8 is about 12.6992 mph. But maybe answer: The wind velocity is 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, check: Given relation: P = k A V^3, k = 1/256. Then for A=4, P=32, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, which gives V^3 = (32*256)/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, numerical approximate: V \u2248 12.70 mph.\n\nI want to double-check: If V=8 mph, then P= (1/256)*2*512= (1/256)*1024=4, which checks out.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: V \u2248 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll answer with explanation.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in final message with \\boxed{...}.

Find k using the given values:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nSubstitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express this as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThis is the exact form of the wind velocity. To find an approximate value, note that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, which is approximately 1.5874.

So plug: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. But 8^3=512, so 4= k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow second part: find V when A=4, P=32. So equation: 32 = k * 4 * V^3 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Now compute cube root of 2048. Let's see: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, so it's between. Wait, I can simplify: 2048=2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). That is not a nice integer. Alternatively, maybe I'm mistaken: Let's re-check: k= 4/ (2*512)= 4/1024= 1/256, then equation: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32= (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so V^3= 32*64=2048, cube root of 2048 is 12.7 approximately. But maybe I need to check: 12.7^3 is around 2048? Let's compute: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7*12.7, but that's approximate. Alternatively, we can simplify: 2048= 2^11, cube root of 2^11= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4, so answer is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe the problem expects that answer. Alternatively, if we simplify further: 4=2^2, so cube root of 4= 2^(2/3). So answer: V= 8*2^(2/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so answer is: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait, we might check if we can simplify to a rational number. Let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer. But maybe the problem expects a decimal approximated value: 8 * cube root of 4 mph, cube root of 4 approximates 1.5874, so product approx 12.699 mph, which is about 12.7 mph.\n\nBut maybe I can re-check the given: \"When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds.\" That gives k=1/256. Then for A=4, P=32, then equation: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4 mph. So answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nHowever, maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= (4)^(1/3)? Actually, cube root of 4 is 4^(1/3). So answer: V= 8*(4)^(1/3) mph. Alternatively, we can write as V= 2^(3+2/3)=2^(11/3) mph.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects a numerical answer. So answer: V= approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI can check: 12.7 mph cubed is about 2048. So answer: V= 12.70 mph approximately.\n\nI must include final answer in a boxed expression: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph. But I'll check if the problem expects a numeric answer: \"Find the wind velocity\" means answer in mph. So I'll give answer as: V= 8*(cube root of 4) mph or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph. But I'll also mention approximate value.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a final answer box.\n\nI'll produce final answer with step-by-step explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph. Alternatively, if I want a decimal: \\boxed{12.70\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer with both forms.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph (approximately 12.70 mph)}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have equation: P = k * A * V^3. Given data: when V=8, A=2, P=4, so k = P / (A * V^3) = 4/(2*8^3) = 4/(2*512) = 4/(1024) = 1/256. So equation is: P = (1/256)*A*V^3.\n\nNow second scenario: A=4, P=32, so then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so simplify: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor 2048: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can find approximate value: 2^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, then multiplied by 8 gives about 12.7 mph. But likely the answer should be expressed as 8*2^(2/3) mph exactly, or maybe cube root of 2048 mph.\n\nLet's check: 8^3 = 512, 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so cube root of 2048 is between 12 and 13. But it's exactly 2^(11/3). But the question might be answered as \"the wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph\" or \"the wind velocity is cube root of 2048 mph.\" But maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = cube root of (8) * cube root of (256) = 2 * cube root of (256) but that doesn't simplify nicely. Let's check: 256=2^8, so cube root of 2^8 = 2^(8/3) = 2^(2+2/3) = 4*2^(2/3). So then 2 * 4*2^(2/3) = 8*2^(2/3) mph. So answer: 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nLet me check: 8*2^(2/3) mph = 8*(2^(2/3)) mph = approximate value: 2^(2/3)= approx 1.5874, times 8 equals 12.699 mph approx. So answer: about 12.70 mph.\n\nWait check: if we plug in: 32 = (1/256)*4*(12.699)^3. Let's check: (12.699)^3 = approx 2048, then product equals (4/256)*2048 = (1/64)*2048= 32 exactly. So it's consistent.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is cube root of 2048 mph, which simplifies to 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nI can also express answer as: V = cube root of (32*64) = cube root of (2048) mph.\n\nI'll express answer as: V = cube root of 2048 mph = 8 * cube root of 4 mph? Wait, let's try: cube root of 2048= cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer is exactly that.\n\nI'll now produce answer: The wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. I'll produce answer in a final message. We'll produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation: Since P = k A V^3, we have k=4/(2*8^3)=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for new scenario, 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, then V= cube root of 2048=8*2^(2/3). So answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer with box. I'll produce answer as: \\boxed{8\\cdot2^{2/3}\\text{ mph}}.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given information:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003So, 4 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Thus, k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003We are told that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we need to find V.\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the right-hand side:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\text{ mph}}\n\nThis is the exact answer.

We are given: when velocity=8 mph, sail area=2 ft^2, pressure=4 pounds. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k*2*512 = k*1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then second scenario: A=4, P=32. Then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we want a simpler form maybe: 2^(11/3) = 8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can try to see if 2048 is a perfect cube. 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so not perfect cube. Alternatively, express as: V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). But maybe we want an approximate value: cube root of 2048 = e^( (11/3)*ln2 ) = e^( (11/3)*0.693 ) = e^(2.543) = 12.72 mph approx. But wait: Let me check: 12.7^3 = 12.7^3? Let's check: 12.7^3= about 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 = (12.7*12.7=161.29, times 12.7 equals 2048.383) So yes approx. Alternatively, maybe the answer expects \"12.7 mph\" or \"2^(11/3) mph\". But wait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 12.7 mph approx. But let me check: Actually, 8 mph is given. But then if the area doubles and pressure quadruples, then the wind velocity? Let's check: P= k A V^3. For the first scenario: 4 = k*2*512, k=4/1024=1/256. For second scenario: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. 2048 is not a perfect cube, but it's 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3)= 2^(9/3+2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity = 8 * cube root of 4? Wait, 2^(2/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)= 4^(1/3) so answer: 8* cube root of 4 mph. But cube root of 4 is not simpler than 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can express as: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, but that's not simpler than 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express as: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2, which is cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But that is not exactly \"nice\" number. But maybe we want an approximate decimal. Let me check: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699 mph approx. So answer: approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nWait, but the problem expects a result.

This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given data:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, we have\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, this becomes\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the value of k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are given that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, the equation becomes\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nStep 4. Approximate the value:\nCalculating the cube root of 4 gives approximately 1.5874, so\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(or approximately 12.7 mph).",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So equation: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Then when V = 8 mph, A = 2, P = 4. So we solve for k: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. Note that 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then the equation is P = (1/256) * A * V^3. Then find wind velocity when P=32, A=4, so: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, or 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64) * V^3. So then multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. So then V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute cube root: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048, so cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. But we can also compute approximate value: cube root of 2048 = 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 approximates 2048. But let's see: Actually, 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 approximates? Alternatively, we can compute exactly: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But the answer might be given in radical form: V = 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 4 is not an integer. Alternatively, we can note: 2048 = 8^3 * 2? Let's check: 8^3=512, not 2048. Wait, let's check: Actually, 8^3=512, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so V is between 12 and 13. Let's do: 12.7^3 approximates 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048.023, so V approx 12.7 mph. But maybe we can simplify the expression: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph, or V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as cube root of 2048 mph. But then we can simplify further: 8 * cube root of 4 mph is the simplest radical form.\n\nWait, let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3)= 2^(9/3)*2^(2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, cube root of 4 mph times 8 mph, that's the answer.\n\nWe can also check: (8*2^(2/3))^3 = 8^3 * 2^2 = 512 * 4 = 2048, so it's correct.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express as: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}} mph, or equivalently, \\boxed{8 \\cdot 2^{2/3}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.

Given: When velocity is 8 mph, pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. So we have 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. Then k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Next, we need to find wind velocity when pressure is 32 pounds and sail area is 4 square feet. So we have: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. Simplify: 4/256 = 1/64. So equation becomes: 32 = (1/64)* V^3, multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11, since 2^11 = 2048. So cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so V ~ 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But we can also express exactly as 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can check: 8 * 2^(2/3) mph is the answer. But perhaps we can simplify further: 8 * 2^(2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 2^(11/3). So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But wait, let me check: if V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). So answer is: V = 2^(11/3) mph, which is about 12.70 mph.\n\nWe can also express as: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when velocity is 8 mph and area is 2 square feet, pressure is 4 pounds. So substitute: 4 = k * 2 * (8)^3. Evaluate: 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. Then k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So constant is 1/256.\n\nNow question: find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. So use: P = k * A * V^3, so 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3. Solve: 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now find cube root: cube root of 2048. Let's factor: 2048 = 2^? Actually 2^11 = 2048. So V^3 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But likely they want a numerical answer. But 2^(11/3) is not an integer. Let's check: 2^(11/3) = (2^(1/3))^11. But we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = 2 * cube root of 256 = 2 * 6.3496? Wait, check: Actually, we can check: 8^3 =512, 10^3=1000, so it's between 10 and 11. But let's solve: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6667)= approximate value. Let's compute: 2^(11/3) = exp((11/3)*ln2) = exp(3.66667*0.6931)= exp(2.540)= 12.7 approx. Let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7^3 = 2047.9 approx. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph. But maybe we can express answer exactly in radical form: V = 8 * cube root of 4. Wait, let's check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(9/3+2/3)=2^3*2^(2/3)=8*(2^(2/3)). But 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, so answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as cube root of 2048. Let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nLet me check: 8*(cube root of 4) mph is the exact answer. But wait: Actually, 2^(2/3)= cube root of (2^2)= cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But we can also simplify: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8 * (2^(2/3)). That is the answer. Alternatively, we can write: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nBut let me double-check: 4 * (1/256) = 4/256 = 1/64, so equation: 32 = (1/64)* V^3, then V^3 = 32*64=2048. So V= cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8 *2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nHowever, wait, check: Actually, 8*(cube root of 4) = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. So answer is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI must check: \"When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds.\" That gives k = 4/(2*8^3) = 4/(2*512)= 4/1024= 1/256. So then when A=4, P=32, so 32= (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32= (4/256)* V^3= (1/64)* V^3 => V^3=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8*cuberoot(4). So answer: V=8*cuberoot(4) mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI must provide answer in a neat step by step explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003Substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nStep 2. Compute (8)\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003(8)\u00b3 = 512\n\nStep 3. Solve for k:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 4. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 5. Simplify the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Note that 4/256 simplifies to 1/64, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 6. Solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 7. Find V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nStep 8. Express 2048 as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nStep 9. Rewrite 2^(11/3) in a more simplified form:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}\n\nThis is the exact answer. If you prefer a decimal approximation, note that \u221b4 is approximately 1.5874, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph.",

So plug in: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So use: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. Solve: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32 * 64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^? Let's compute: 2^11 = 2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But that is not an integer. Alternatively, maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe the answer expects an exact form. Alternatively, maybe we can factor differently: 2048 = 2^11. The cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3). That is the exact value. But maybe we can approximate: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6667) approx? Let's compute: 2^3 = 8, 2^(3.6667) approx? Actually, we can compute: cube root of 2048 = 12.7 approx? Let's check: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so it's between 12 and 13. Alternatively, we can write as 8 * 2^(2/3) exactly.\n\nWait, let me re-check the constant: k = 4 / (2 * 512) = 4 / 1024 = 1/256 indeed.\n\nNow solve: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3 => Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root (2048). 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) mph. That is the answer.\n\nWe can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But likely answer: V = 8 * cube root (4)? Not exactly.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2^2, which is cube root of 4. So V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is a valid answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as: V = 8 * 4^(1/3) mph.\n\nBut check: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8 * 4^(1/3). Alternatively, V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me check approximate value: 2^(11/3) = exp((11/3)*ln2) = exp(3.6667*0.6931) = exp(2.543) = about 12.71 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nBut wait, check: 12.7^3 = 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7. 12.7*12.7 = 161.29, times 12.7 = 2048.383? So yes.\n\nThus answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph exactly, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is about 12.7 mph.\n\nI can now produce final answer in boxed form.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. \nI'll produce answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer.

This gives us the equation:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1.

            "solution": "We are given that pressure P varies jointly as area A and cube of wind's velocity V. So relation: P = k A V^3, where k is constant. Given: when velocity=8 mph, area=2, pressure=4 pounds. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when area=4, pressure=32. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Now cube root: cube root of 2048? Let's factor: 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But is that simplified? Alternatively, we can find approximate value: cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. But we can also simplify: 2^(11/3) is not an integer. Let's check: Actually, wait: 2^(11/3) = (2^(3*3+2/3)? Actually 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 12.7 mph approximately. But is there a nicer fraction? Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8*(cube root of 4). Alternatively, maybe the answer is expressed as 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, check: 8^3=512, 4^3=64, product: 512*64=32768, not 2048. Let's recompute: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4V^3, then 32*256 = 8192, then 4V^3=8192, so V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, which is indeed 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3). That is the answer.\n\nWe can also compute approximate: 2^(11/3) = exp((11/3)*ln2) = exp(3.6666*0.693) = exp(2.539) = 12.67 mph approximately. But let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66667) = 2^3 * 2^(0.66667) = 8 * (cube root of 2^2) = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approx. 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also check: if V = 12.7 mph, then V^3 approx. 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048 approx. So answer is consistent.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}, or more exact: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box. We'll produce answer with final answer in the box.\n\nI'll produce final answer with explanation: The constant k is computed from the given values: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k*1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then substitute into new equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 8192/4 = 2048, and then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) mph. That is the answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box with explanation.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1.

Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 256:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192, so:\n\u2003\u20038192 = 4V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Divide both sides by 4:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192 / 4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\u2003\u2003This can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is 2^(11/3) miles per hour, or equivalently, 8\u221b4 mph. In decimal form, this is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThe final answer is:\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}.",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. We are given: when velocity is 8 mph, area is 2 sq ft, pressure is 4 pounds. So plug: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so equation becomes: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. Then we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So plug: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So compute: 4/256 = 1/64, so equation becomes: 32 = (1/64)* V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want a decimal approximation. Alternatively, maybe the answer is in radical form: V = 8 * (2^(2/3)) mph, but that is messy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an integer value if we simplify: Let's re-check: Actually, maybe we can simplify: 32 = (1/64)* V^3, then V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, which is not a perfect cube. Wait, is it possible that I misread? Let's check: \"when the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure is 4 pounds\", so constant k = 4/(2*(8^3)) = 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then when area=4 and pressure=32, then equation becomes: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, express as 8 * cube root of 4. Because 2^(2/3) = cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want to simplify further: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so V ~ 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699, roughly 12.7 mph. But likely they want an exact expression: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, let me check: Actually, check: 8^3=512, so if velocity is 8 mph, then pressure on 2 sq ft is 1/256 *2*512 = 4, so that's consistent. So answer: wind velocity = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects a simpler answer. Let me check: \"varies jointly as area and cube of velocity\", so formula: P = k A V^3. Then k = P/(A V^3). For given values: k = 4/(2*8^3)= 4/(2*512)= 4/1024=1/256. Then for new values: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) no, wait, 8*256=2048, so cube root of 2048= cube root of (8*256)= 2* cube root of 256, but 256= 4^4? Actually, 256= 2^8, so cube root of 2^8=2^(8/3)= 2^(2+2/3)=4*2^(2/3). Then times 2 gives 2*4*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). Yes. So answer: 8*2^(2/3) mph or 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if they want a decimal: approx. 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer in a neat form: Let V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is final answer.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation: step-by-step.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in text.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003We are given that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb, we need to find V. Substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant term:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2\u00b2, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\n\nIf a decimal approximation is needed, note that \u221b4 is approximately 1.5874, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph.",

When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe need to determine the constant of variation and then solve for V.\n\nGiven: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, then P = 4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So k = 1/256.\n\nNow we have: P = (1/256)*A*V^3. Then, for A = 4, P = 32, so 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4 * V^3. 32*256 = 8192. So 8192 = 4 V^3, so V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048, and V = cube root of 2048.\n\nWe need to compute cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^11 because 2^11 = 2048. Then cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = 2 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of (2^8) = 2 * 2^(8/3) = 2^(1+8/3) = 2^(11/3). Not simpler.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But the problem likely expects a simplified radical expression or a decimal. But maybe we can simplify: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But that doesn't look like a nice number. Wait, check: 2^(11/3) is not equal to 8 * cube root of 4? Let's recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4. So answer is: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But can we simplify further? Possibly not.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 4 ~ 1.5874, then multiplied by 8 gives ~12.699 mph. But maybe the answer should be expressed exactly as 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = cube root of 2^11 = cube root of 2048. Alternatively, 2048^(1/3) = 12.7 mph approx.\n\nBut let me check: Actually, maybe I made a mistake: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for 4 square feet and 32 pounds: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). Yes, that is correct.\n\nWe can also express that as 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3+2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut maybe we can also write as 4^(1/3) * 8? Wait, check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4, so yes.\n\nI can express answer as: V = 8 * \u221b4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThus final answer: wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph (exact value) or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a boxed expression.\n\nI'll produce: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}} mph or \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph.\n\nI'll produce: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer accordingly.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003So, 4 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = 1024k\n\u2003\u2003Solving for k:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Now, 32 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 256:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Calculate 32 \u00d7 256:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20038192 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Divide both sides by 4:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192/4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048.\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\u2003\u2003We can also write this as:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) = \u221b(2\u00b2) = \u221b4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is exactly 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 miles per hour, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" \n\nGiven: P \u221d A * V^3. So we have: P = k A V^3. Given: when V=8, A=2, P=4. Then we find k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, then k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then new condition: P=32, A=4, find V such that 32 = (1/256)* 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^11, so cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, but maybe can simplify further: approximate value: cube root of 4 ~ 1.5874, so V ~ 12.6992 mph, but we might leave answer in exact form. Alternatively, if we want to express it as 2^(11/3) mph. However, the problem expects a simplified exact answer.\n\nBut wait, check: 2048 = 2^11, cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3) = 8*(cube root of 4). That is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to compute approximate value: V \u2248 12.7 mph.\n\nLet's check: 8 mph originally gives P=4, with area 2, so k=1/256. Then for A=4, V^3 = 2048, V = cube root of 2048. So answer is cube root of 2048 mph. We can also express that as 8 cube root of 4 mph, which is the same. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. \n\nWait, let me re-check: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k=4/1024 = 1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32= (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, then multiply both sides by 64: 32*64= V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3=2048, so V = cube root of 2048, which is 2^(11/3). That is correct.\n\nSo answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph. That is the final answer.\n\nWe can also compute approximate value: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = 2^3 *2^(0.6666)=8*1.5874=12.6992 mph approx.\n\nThus answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4) mph or about 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. I'll produce answer in final message. I'll produce final answer message in the final answer message.\n\nI'll produce answer message in final answer message: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}} or \\boxed{2^{11/3}\\ \\text{mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer message in final answer message.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nSo, V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express this as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 \u221b(2\u00b2) = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate value, note that \u221b4 is about 1.587, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So relation: P = k * A * V^3. Given that when V = 8 mph, A = 2 sq ft, P = 4 pounds. Solve for constant k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now given new scenario: A = 4 sq ft, P = 32 pounds, find V. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, i.e. 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^? Let's check: 2^11 = 2048. So V^3 = 2^11, then V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. But check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666) approximates? But maybe we want an exact expression. Alternatively, we can compute cube root of 2048: 2048^(1/3) = 12.7? Let's see: 12.7^3 ~ 2048? Actually 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 2048. So maybe we want to simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). Alternatively, we can check: if V = 16 mph? Let's check: 16^3 = 4096, not 2048. So it's not 16 mph. But wait, let's check: 8 mph cube is 512, so scaling factor: 2^? Wait, we can solve: V^3 = 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3). But maybe we want decimal approximate: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6667) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6667) = 8 * cube root of 2^2 = 8 * cube root of 4. Cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, so V approx = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But check: 12.699 mph. But wait, check: (1/256)*4*(12.699^3) approximates 32? Let's check: 12.699^3 approximates 2048 exactly. So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph or approximately 12.70 mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But wait, can we simplify further? Actually, 2^(11/3) = (2^3)*(2^(2/3)) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express as cube root of 2048 mph. But 2^(2/3) is not 2^(1/3)? Wait, let's check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want a simplified fraction: cube root of 4 is not a rational number. So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, let's check: given k = 1/256, then P = (1/256)*A*V^3. For A=4, P=32, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). Yes.\n\nThus answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph. However, let's check: 8 mph gives 4 pounds on 2 ft^2. Then 4 ft^2 gives double area, so pressure doubles if velocity constant. But if we want pressure 32 pounds, then factor is 8 times bigger than 4 pounds, but then the velocity must be adjusted. Let's check: if velocity is v, then P \u221d v^3, so v^3 must be 8 times bigger than when v=8 mph? But 8^3 = 512, so 8*512=4096, so v^3=4096, then v= cube root of 4096 = 16 mph. Wait, let's check: Actually, let's recalc: For A=2, P=4, then k = 4/(2*(8^3)) = 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. For A=4, if we want P=32, then equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*v^3, so v^3 = 32*256/4=32*64=2048, v= cube root of 2048. But cube root of 2048 is not 16 mph because 16^3=4096. So let's recalc: 8 mph gives 512. Then doubling area gives 1024 if velocity constant. To get 32 pounds, factor is 32/4=8 times bigger than original pressure. So v^3 must be 8 times bigger than 512, i.e. 512*8=4096. Wait, check: originally, for A=2 and v=8 mph, pressure=4. If we double the area to 4, then with the same velocity, pressure would double to 8, not 32. But we want 32, which is 4 times 8. So v must be increased such that v^3 is 4 times greater than 512, i.e. v^3=512*4=2048. Wait, check: 512*4=2048, not 4096. Let's recalc: For A=2 and v=8 mph, pressure=4. Then if we double area to 4, then for same velocity, pressure=8. But we want 32, which is 4 times 8, so v^3 must be 4 times bigger than 512, i.e. 512*4=2048. Then v = cube root of 2048. But cube root of 2048 is not 16 mph because 16^3=4096, but 12.7^3 is about 2048, so v is about 12.7 mph. Let's check: 12.7^3 approximates 2048, yes.\n\nWait, check consistency: For A=2, v=8 mph, P=4. For A=4, v=12.7 mph, then P = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3). 12.7^3 approximates 2048, then P= (1/256)*4*2048 = (4*2048)/256=8192/256=32, so it's consistent.\n\nBut let's check: 12.7^3 exactly equals? Actually, 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7. Let me compute: 12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7 equals 2048.383, so approximate. But the exact value is 2^(11/3) mph. So answer: v = 2^(11/3) mph, approximately 12.70 mph. But wait, let me re-check: Pressure P = k * A * V^3, k=1/256, A=4, P=32. Then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, multiply both sides by 256 gives: 32*256 = 4*V^3, then V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (32*64)=2048. So V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3). So answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can write as: V = 2^(11/3) mph. We can also express as: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. That is the exact answer.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, but let me check: For A=2, V=8 mph, then V^3=512, then k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. For A=4, then P= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3. So to have P=32, we need (1/64)*V^3=32, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3). So that's consistent.\n\nThus answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll provide final answer in boxed answer.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a final answer message in a final answer message. We'll include explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer with boxed answer: \\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{12.70 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer message.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, we have\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, this becomes\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nNow, we are given A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds. Plug these into the formula:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus,\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis is the exact value of the wind velocity. If you wish to approximate it numerically, note that\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, we get\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ mph}}\u2003\u2003\u2003(or approximately 12.70 mph).",

            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" This is a joint variation problem. Let P = k A V^3. We know that when A=2, V=8, then P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then we want: when A=4, P=32, then 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So solve for V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3, so 8192 = 4 V^3, then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11=2048, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)? Wait check: 2^11 = 2048, cube root gives 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But perhaps we want a simpler representation? Alternatively, we can check: maybe 2048 = 8^3? 8^3=512, no 8^3=512. 16^3=4096, 17^3=4913, so no. Wait, let's check: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, 17^3=4913, so no integer cube. Possibly we can simplify: 2^(11/3) is not simplified. But maybe we want to simplify to radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express as: V = 8*(2^(2/3)) mph. But maybe we want decimal approximations? Let's check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4 = approximately 1.5874, so then V ~ 8*1.5874 = 12.699 mph, approx 12.70 mph. But let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666) = about 12.7 mph. But wait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.66666) = 8*2^(2/3). But wait, 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 8* (cube root of 4) mph.\n\nWait, I must recalc carefully: Given that P = k A V^3, k=1/256. Then for A=4, P=32, so equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Now factor 2048: 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph, or V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. But note: 2^(2/3)= cube root of (2^2)= cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4) mph, which is approximately 8*1.5874=12.699 mph. But let me check: 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666)= about 12.7 mph. So answer: about 12.70 mph. But wait, check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also write answer as V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But let me check: 8* cube root of 4 = 8*(cube root of 4) mph. Alternatively, we can express it as V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also check: (8 cube root of 4)^3 = 8^3 * cube root of 4^3 = 512*4=2048, which is consistent.\n\nSo answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI can also express answer as: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}} mph, or about 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box.

Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nMultiply both sides by 256 to eliminate the fraction:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20038192 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192 / 4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4 (because 2^(2/3) = \u221b(2\u00b2) = \u221b4), we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate value, note that \u221b4 \u2248 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P is jointly proportional to the area A and cube of the wind's velocity V. That is, P = k A V^3, where k is constant of proportionality.\n\nGiven: when V=8 mph and A=2, then P=4. So equation: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nThen we are asked: find V when P=32 and A=4. So equation: 32 = k * 4 * V^3 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (V^3)/64. So then multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Now find cube root: V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^11 = 2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But we can also simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we want a decimal approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8*1.5874 = 12.699, approx 12.7 mph. But let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 12.7^3 = 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048? Possibly not exactly. But I'll check: cube root of 2048 exactly equals 2^(11/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approx 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, but let me re-check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048. So cube root of 2048 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3).

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So P = k * A * V^3 for some constant k.\n\nGiven: When V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4 pounds. So substitute: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so equation: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when A=4, P=32. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4* V^3. Multiply: (1/256)*4 = 4/256 = 1/64. So equation: 32 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3, i.e. 2048 = V^3. Now find cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^11 (2^11=2048). So cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But the answer might be simplified as 2^(11/3) mph, or approximate value? Wait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) which is about 12.7 mph? Let me recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6667) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6667) = 8 * 1.6 = 12.8 mph. But let's do it exactly: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But perhaps the answer expects an answer in mph in simplest radical form: 8 * cube root of 4. Because 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph. But maybe they want a decimal approximation? The question says \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" I can express it as V = cube root of 2048 mph, which equals 2^(11/3) mph. But perhaps simpler is: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: 8 cube root of 4 = 8*(cube root of 4). Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256)= 2 cube root of 256? Wait, let's recalc: 2048= 8*256? Actually, 8*256=2048. Then cube root of (8*256)= cube root of 8 * cube root of 256=2* cube root of 256. But cube root of 256= 256^(1/3)= 2^(8/3)= 2^(2.6667)? That is not simpler. Let's see: 2^(11/3) is simplest.\n\nWait, I'll check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.66667)= 2^3 * 2^(0.66667)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8 cube root of (2^2)= 8 cube root of 4. That is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute approximate: 8 cube root of 4 \u2248 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699. So answer is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: 2^(11/3) mph or 8 cube root of 4 mph or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph, or in simplified radical form: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph, or approximate value: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce answer: \"The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce answer in final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer with final explanation: \"The pressure is given by P = k A V^3. Substituting the given values, we find k=1/256. Then substituting into the second scenario, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, which simplifies to V^3 = 2048, so V = \u221b2048 = 2^(11/3)=8\u221b4 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce final answer accordingly. We'll produce answer. We'll produce final answer in final answer box.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the first set of values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 8\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024.\n\u2003\u2003Thus, k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.\n\nStep 2. Use k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003Now, when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we have:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the constant:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64.\n\u2003\u2003So, 32 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048, so V\u00b3 = 2048.\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048.\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3).\n\u2003\u2003This can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221b4.\n\nThus, the wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or equivalently, 8\u221b4 mph. In approximate decimal form, this is about 12.7 mph.\n\nThe final answer is:\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}.",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So mathematically: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when velocity is 8 mph and area is 2 square feet, pressure is 4 pounds. Then compute constant k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Next, find V when area is 4 square feet and pressure is 32 pounds. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Then find V: cube root of 2048. Let's check: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^10 = 1024, 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)? Wait, 11/3 = 3 + 2/3, so equals 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8* cube root of 2^2 = 8* cube root of 4. But maybe we can simplify: cube root of 2048 is 12.7? Wait, let's check: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so 12.7 is approximate. But maybe we want an exact expression in terms of radicals: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= (2^(1/3))^11, but that's not simpler. Wait, let me re-check: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3). That is the exact expression. Alternatively, maybe we can write it as 2^(11/3)= (2^(3+2/3))=8*2^(2/3)=8* cube root of 4. But typically answer in radical form: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want a decimal approximations: 8 * cube root of 4, cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so equals about 12.699 mph. But the problem probably expects answer as \"8* cube root of 4 mph\" or \"2^(11/3)\" mph.\n\nLet's check: The pressure P = (1/256)*A*V^3. For A=4, P=32, then V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (8192)/4 = 2048, as computed. So V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.6666) is around 12.7 mph. But wait, is that consistent with the given units? The original velocity is in mph, so yes.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or equivalently, cube root of 2048 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3)=8* cube root of 4. So answer is V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut maybe we can simplify: 2^(2/3) = (cube root of 4). So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nDouble-check: If V=8 cube root of 4 mph, then V^3 = (8 cube root of 4)^3 = 512 * 4 = 2048, then pressure P = (1/256)*4*2048 = (1/256)*8192 = 32, correct.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI can present the answer as: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a neat format: \nGiven that P = k A V^3, from the first condition: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3)= k*2*512=1024k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then using second condition: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3)=8* cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with explanation.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" This means: P = k A V^3, where k is a constant.\n\nWe are given: when V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, then P=4 lbs. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So then: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then we are asked: find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So we have: 32 = k * 4 * V^3, where k=1/256. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now we compute cube root of 2048. Let's factor: 2048=2^? 2^11 = 2048? Actually 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we want to express as radical form. Alternatively, we can check: 8^3=512, 10^3=1000, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so not integer. Alternatively, note that 2048=2^11. Then V = 2^(11/3). That is the answer. But maybe we want decimal approximations: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666)=8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, so product is about 12.699. Alternatively, we can compute: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8^3 * 2^2) = 8 * cube root of 4, as above. But the problem likely expects an answer in simplest radical form: V = 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, check: The problem said: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph. But is that the simplest form? Alternatively, we can express answer as: 2^(11/3) mph. Let me check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8\u221b(2^2)=8\u221b4 mph. So answer: 8\u221b4 mph. Alternatively, we can also simplify: cube root of 4 is not further simplified. So answer: 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, is that the answer? Let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph approximates to 8 * 1.5874=12.699 mph approx.\n\nI can double-check: k=1/256, so P= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so 32= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3= 32*64=2048, then V= cube root of 2048. 2048=8*256=8*256=8*256? Wait, let me recalc: 32*64= 2048. 2^11=2048, so V=2^(11/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8\u221b4 mph. So answer is correct.\n\nThus final answer: wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph. I'll put answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer in boxed environment: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation. We'll produce answer with explanation: \"Since P varies jointly as A and V^3, we have P = kAV^3. Using given data, when V=8 mph and A=2, P=4, so 4 = k*2*8^3 = k*2*512 = 1024k, so k=4/1024=1/256. Then for P=32 and A=4, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, and V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3)=8\u221b4 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce final answer with explanation. We'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given information:\n\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, the pressure P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003Substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = 1024k\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity for the new conditions:\n\u2003Now, when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation is:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003We have V\u00b3 = 2048. Notice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u00b2\u00b9\u00b9\u221a\u00b3 = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221b(2\u00b2) = 8\u221b4\n\nSo the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, and P=4 pounds. So 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3=512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then the formula: P = (1/256)* A * V^3.\n\nWe are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So we plug in: 32 = (1/256)* 4 * V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4 * V^3. 32*256 = 8192. Then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. Now find cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But probably they want a numerical answer. Alternatively, check: 2^(11/3)=? Let's compute approximate value: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^0.6666 = 8 * 2^(2/3) approximately 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But perhaps they want answer in radical form: 8 * cube root(4)? Actually, wait: 2^(2/3) = cube root of (2^2)= cube root of 4. So answer = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But we can simplify further: cube root of 4 is not a rational number. Alternatively, we can express as cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph. Alternatively, we can also note that 2048=8^3? Let's check: 8^3=512, no. 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197. So no integer cube.\n\nWait, check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * (cube root of 4) \u2248 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph. But the question might be expecting an exact answer in terms of radicals, i.e., V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut we can simplify further: cube root of 4 = cube root of (2^2). So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nLet's check: 4 square feet, 32 pounds, then equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. And cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). Yes.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in final message. We'll produce answer as: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. We'll produce answer with reasoning. We'll produce final answer in a box. We'll produce final answer.

We'll produce final answer. We'll produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nSubstitute A = 4, P = 32, and k = 1/256 into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 256 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 256:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192\n\nNow, solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u20034 \u00b7 V\u00b3 = 8192\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192 / 4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Find V by taking the cube root of 2048:\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 because 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048. Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) mph\n\nAlternatively, you can express 2^(2/3) as \u221b(4), so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b(4) mph\n\nThis is the exact answer. For an approximate value, note that \u221b(4) \u2248 1.5874, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

That is: P = k A V^3, where k is constant. We are told: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, and P = 4. So we can solve for k: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512. So k = 4 / (2 * 512) = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.

Solve for V: V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, but check: 2^11 = 2048. But cube root of 2^11 equals 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can compute: 2048 is not a perfect cube. Alternatively, maybe we can solve: 32 = (1/64)*V^3 implies V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Alternatively, we can compute: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8 * 256) = cube root of 8 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of 256. But cube root of 256 is not an integer. Let's try: 6^3 = 216, 7^3 = 343, so it's between 6 and 7. Wait: 2048 is not between 216 and 343. Wait, recalc: 2^11 = 2048, then cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) ~ 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 1.6 = 12.8 approx. But check: 2^(0.6666) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4, which is about 1.5874. So then 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699. So V is approximately 12.7 mph. But let me recalc exactly: V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express it as 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, so answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph. But I can also check: 8\u221b4 approximates to 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, but maybe I can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = (2^3 * 2^(2/3)) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can write answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nLet's double-check: P = (1/256)*A*V^3. For A=4, V=2^(11/3), then P = (1/256)*4*(2^(11)) = (4/256)*2^(11) = (1/64)*2048 = 32. So correct.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}. But then I'll show the reasoning steps.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, we have\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, this becomes\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are given that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we need to find V. Substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}",

So plug: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow given: find wind velocity when pressure is 32 pounds on 4 ft^2 sail. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Simplify: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's simplify: 2048=2^11, so cube root of 2^11=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we want a decimal? Actually, maybe we want an exact answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 4 approx= 1.5874, times 8 = 12.699, so approx 12.7 mph. But wait, let me check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = 2^3.6666 approx = 12.7 mph.\n\nWait but maybe the answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But is that simplified?

With P=32, A=4, then V = (32*256/4)^(1/3)= (32*64)^(1/3)= (2048)^(1/3)= 2048^(1/3)= 2^(11/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.

Then plug in known values: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, then k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find velocity when P = 32 and A=4. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4* V^3. Simplify: 32 = (4/256) V^3 = (1/64) V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 as 2^? Let's see: 2^11 = 2048. So V^3 = 2^11, then V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8*2^(2/3) = 8*(cube root of 4). But we can also express it as 2^(11/3). Alternatively, check: if V = 8 mph, then cube of 8 is 512, but then 4/256 * 512 = 4*2 = 8, no. Let's recalc carefully: P = k A V^3. k = 1/256. For new values: P=32, A=4, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Yes. So cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). That is not a nice integer. But maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe the answer is expressed as a radical: 8\u221b4 mph.

Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, we can check: 8 mph is the known speed for the given data. But then our new velocity is bigger. Let's check approximate value: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8 * 1.5874 \u2248 12.699, so velocity is about 12.7 mph.

Yes.\n\nLet's check: 8 mph: 8^3 = 512, times 2 gives 1024, times 1/256 gives 4. Yes.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, or exactly 2^(11/3) mph. But let me check: 2^(11/3) mph. But if I want to simplify further: 2^(11/3) mph = (2^(1/3))^11 mph. Not simpler.\n\nAlternatively, we can write: V = (2048)^(1/3). 2048^(1/3) = (2^11)^(1/3) = 2^(11/3) mph. That is the answer.\n\nThus answer: 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, check: 8\u221b4 mph is the same as 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph. But let me check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4, so yes.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph. But can we simplify that further? Possibly we can express it as 2^(11/3) mph. I'll answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nWait, but wait: The problem statement said \"wind's velocity\" and \"miles per hour\", so the answer is in mph. But then the answer is not an integer mph. So answer: wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph or 8\u221b4 mph.

So yes.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is (2048)^(1/3) mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI can express the answer as: V = cube root of 2048 mph = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll then produce final answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nWait, let me check: 8\u221a[3]4 mph is the same as 8\u221b4 mph.

Yes.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So the relation: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: When V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So substitute: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So then k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds: P=32, A=4, unknown velocity V. Use formula: 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32 * 64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Now compute: 2048=2^11? Let's check: 2^11=2048 indeed. But 2^11 = 2048. But we want cube root: cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). But the problem likely expects a simpler answer if it is exact? Actually check: 2^(11/3) is not an integer. Let's check: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, so it's not integer. Wait maybe I've done arithmetic incorrectly: Let's re-check: 8^3=512, so 2 * 512 = 1024, yes. So k=4/1024=1/256. Then new equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)* V^3= (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64=2048 = V^3. Cube root of 2048 is not an integer: 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 is about 2048? Actually, let me compute: 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7. But I'd like to express in radical form: V= cube root of 2048. Factor 2048= 2^11. So cube root of 2^11=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). That is the answer. But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V=8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, V= 8*(4)^(1/3). But can we simplify further? 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, so 8*1.5874=12.699. So V approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, but let me re-read the problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So the relationship is P = k A V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So k= 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for A=4, P=32, find V: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3= 32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048. Now factor 2048= 2^11, so V= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3)= 8*(cube root of 4). So answer: 8*(cube root of 4) mph. That is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if we want a decimal: V approx 12.7 mph. Let me check: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7=161.29, times 12.7= 2048. So yes.\n\nThus final answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus I'll answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll provide answer in the final answer box.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}. We'll produce final answer in the box.\n\nI'll produce answer in the final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Solve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the right side:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we can also write:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}\n\nIf you prefer a decimal approximation, note that \u221b4 is approximately 1.587, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.7 mph.",

Then we are given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4 pounds. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find V when A=4 and P=32: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want approximate decimal. Wait, let's see: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, which is approx 1.5874, so V = 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph, which is approx 12.70 mph. But we can also express as cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe the answer is expected to be expressed as the cube root of 2048 or 8\u221b(4) mph. But wait, let's check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can also compute: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) ~ 12.7 mph. But wait, is that correct? Let's check: 8 mph cubed is 512, times constant factor k=1/256, times A=2 gives 4. Yes. For the new scenario: A=4, P=32, so equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph, which is approx 12.7 mph. So answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph, which is about 12.7 mph. But wait, is that correct? Let's double-check: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Actually, 12.7^3 = 12.7^3 approximates to 2048. But let me check: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 12.7*12.7=161.29, times 12.7 is 2048.383, so it's correct.\n\nI want to check if we can simplify further: 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) mph = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is acceptable. So answer: wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approx 12.7 mph.\n\nI want to check if we can get an exact fraction: 2^(2/3) is not a rational number.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have P = k A V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4 pounds. So we solve for k: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so then 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then the formula is P = (A V^3)/256.\n\nThen question: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So use P=32, A=4, then 32 = (4 V^3)/256, so multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 V^3, so V^3 = (32 * 256)/4 = (32 * 256)/4 = 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then we take cube root: cube root of 2048. We know 2048 = 2^11, since 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)? Actually 11/3 = 3.6666, so that equals 2^(3+2/3) = 8 * cube root of 2^2 = 8 * cube root of 4. But that's not a nice integer. Let's check: V = cube root(2048) = 12.7? Wait, let me re-check: 12.7^3 = 12.7^3 approximate 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 2048? Possibly it's exactly 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 approximates: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 2048? Let me check: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7. Actually, let's compute: 12.7^3 = (approx) 2048.383? Let me check: Actually, 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = 12.7 * 161.29 = 2047.583? Actually, let me compute exactly: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7. Actually, I can do: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). But 2^(2/3) is not a nice integer. Let me re-check: maybe I made a mistake: given P = k A V^3, and k=1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32 = (4 V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 V^3, then V^3 = (32*256)/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so yes. So V = cube root of 2048. And 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3). That is the exact answer in terms of exponents. But maybe we want a decimal approximation. Alternatively, we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= (2^(3) * 2^(2/3))= 8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, so answer is 8* cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we want a decimal approximation. Alternatively, maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3)= (2^(3) * 2^(2/3))= 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nHowever, let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3.6666 = 12.7 approximately. Let me compute: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, times 8 equals 12.6992 mph approximately.\n\nSo answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, but let me re-read the problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So formula: P = k A V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4. So k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32 = (1/256)*4 V^3, so 32 = (4 V^3)/256, so multiply both sides by 256: 32*256=4 V^3, so V^3= (32*256)/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3) mph, which is exactly 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll provide final answer in a neat box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph} \\text{ (approximately 12.7 mph)}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer. We'll produce answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. We'll produce answer as: \"8 * cube root of 4 mph\" or \"approximately 12.7 mph\".\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph} \\approx 12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a neat box.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means that\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nSubstitute k, A, and P into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 256 to clear the fraction:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 256:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\n\u2003\u20038192 / 4 = V\u00b3  \n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nIf you wish to approximate this value:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u221b4 \u2248 1.5874  \n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.6992 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph} \\quad\\text{(approximately 12.7 mph)}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V = 8 mph, A=2, then P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now find wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. So 32 = k * 4 * V^3, with k = 1/256. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048? Let's check: 32 * 64 = (32*60) + (32*4) = 1920 + 128 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048, so V = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8*(2^(2/3)). But we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) = (cube root of 4) maybe. But then maybe we can simplify: V = 2^(11/3). But is that the answer? Let me check: Alternatively, note that 2048 is 8^3? Actually 8^3=512, so no. Let's check: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096. So no integer. Alternatively, factor: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But then we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But that is the answer in terms of radicals: 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we can simplify: Let V = cube root of 2048. Let's see if it's a nice number: cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is not an integer. Alternatively, we can express as approximately: 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so V approximates 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph, approximately 12.7 mph. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, maybe we can simplify: 2^(2/3) = cube root of (2^2) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nHowever, let's check if we can simplify further: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nLet's check: Pressure = (1/256)*A*V^3. For A=4, V=8 cube root of 4, then V^3 = (8 cube root of 4)^3 = 8^3 * 4 = 512*4 = 2048, then P = (1/256)*4*2048 = (4*2048)/256 = 8192/256 = 32, correct.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut wait, maybe we can simplify further: 8 cube root of 4 = cube root of (8^3 * 4) = cube root of (512*4) = cube root of 2048, which is the same as before.\n\nWe can also write answer as: V = 2^(11/3) mph, or V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI want to check: 8^3=512, times 4 equals 2048, cube root equals 2^(11/3). So answer is: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nLet's check: Alternatively, we can compute: cube root of 2048 is 12.7 mph approx.\n\nThus answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.

This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant of proportionality (k).\n\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = 1024k\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds.\n\nSubstitute k = 1/256, A = 4, and P = 32 into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply (1/256) by 4:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nNow, solve for V\u00b3 by multiplying both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Let me re-read the question: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" We need to find V. Let's denote constant k: P = k A V^3. Given that when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4, so 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 =512, so 2*512 =1024, so 4 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So k=1/256.\n\nNow new condition: A=4, P=32, and unknown V, so equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Now compute cube root of 2048. Let's see: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, so it's between 8 and 16. But perhaps note that 2048=2^11, so cube root equals 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3)? Wait, let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3) which is not an integer. But maybe I can find an integer? Let's check: 2048 = 8^3 is 512, no; 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so no integer. But maybe we can simplify: V^3=2048, so V = cube root of 2048. But perhaps the intended answer is V= 8\u221a[3]{2}? Wait, let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can factor out a cube: 2048= 8*256, but 256 is 4^4, not a perfect cube. Let's factor prime factors: 2048= 2^11, so cube root =2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can express as 8 * cube root of 4? Actually, 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph. But that is not a nice number. Let me check: maybe I miscomputed: Given P= k A V^3, so from the initial condition: 4= k *2*512, so k= 4/(1024)=1/256. Then for new condition: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3= (32*256)/4=32*64=2048, yes.\n\nMaybe the answer is expected in radical form: V= \u221b2048 = \u221b(2^11)=2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8 *2^(2/3)= 8 * \u221b(4). That is the answer. But is that correct? Let's check: 8 * \u221b4 approximately equals 8 * 1.5874=12.699, so velocity is about 12.7 mph. But let me re-read the problem: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" It might be that we are allowed to get a decimal approximation. But maybe the answer is expressed as a radical. Let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3)*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8\u221b(4). Alternatively, we can express as 4\u221b(32) or something else? Let's check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, yes.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake: Let's try to simplify: V^3=2048= 2^11, then V= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: V=8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can also write V= 4\u221b(32) but that's not simpler.\n\nLet's check: 2^(11/3)= (2^3 *2^(2/3))=8*2^(2/3)=8* cube root of 4. So answer: V=8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also check: (8 cube root of 4)^3=8^3*(cube root of 4)^3=512*4=2048. Yes.\n\nThus answer: V=8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also check if maybe I misread the problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P= k A V^3. So initial condition: P=4, A=2, V=8, so k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. So then for new condition: A=4, P=32, so 32= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, then V^3=32*64=2048, then V= cube root of 2048= 2^(11/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8 cube root of 4 mph. So answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nI can also express it as: V= 8\u221b4 mph. I can also approximate: \u221b4 is about 1.5874, so V is about 12.699 mph. But the problem likely expects an exact answer: V= 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nThus I'll answer: The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, or equivalently, 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}}. We'll check if the problem expects mph. Yes.\n\nI'll now produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph. We'll produce answer in final answer box. We'll produce answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the unknown velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply 4 by 1/256:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Find V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus,\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2\u00b2, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b(4)\n\nSo, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\n\nThis is the exact answer in miles per hour.",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have relation: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: when V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, P=4 pounds. So we can solve for k:\n4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow second scenario: P=32 pounds, A=4 square feet, find V such that: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we can also simplify: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we want a decimal approximate value. Let's see: cube root of 4 approx equals 1.5874, so product equals 8*1.5874=12.699. Alternatively, we can express answer exactly as 8\u221b4 mph. However, maybe we can simplify further: Actually, 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666). But it's not a nice rational number. Alternatively, maybe we can simplify: Actually, we can express in radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But is that simpler? Possibly not. Alternatively, we can say: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, but let me check: 8*4^(1/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express as: V = (2048)^(1/3). That might be acceptable.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility to simplify? 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI can also compute approximate value: 2^(2/3) approx 1.5874, so V approx 12.699 mph, approx 12.7 mph.\n\nI can check: if V=12.7 mph, then V^3=12.7^3 approx 2048, and then pressure P = (1/256)*4*(2048) = (4*2048)/256=8192/256=32, so correct.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph, or exactly 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in final answer message.

Find the constant k using the initial conditions:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\u2003\u20038\u00b3 = 512, so:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Thus, k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when:\n\u2003\u2003A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the right side:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

So k = P / (A * V^3) = 4/(2*512) = 4/(1024) = 1/256. Wait, check: 2 * (8^3) = 2*512 = 1024, so k=4/1024 = 1/256. Then new: P=32, A=4, find V such that 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Then V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Wait, check: 32*64=2048, then V= cube root of 2048. But note: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096. 2048 is exactly 2^11? Actually, 2^11=2048, but cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3)? Let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further? Alternatively, we can express answer as V = cube root of 2048. But let me check: Actually, maybe we can simplify: 32= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3= 32*64=2048, V= cube root of 2048. But 2048= 2^11, so V=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can express it as 8* cube root of 4? Wait, 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2= cube root of 4, so V= 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But the problem might require a decimal approximation? But likely we can leave as radical form. Alternatively, we can compute approximate: cube root of 2048 = approximate? Let's see: 12.7^3=2048? Let's check: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7*12.7= 12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7= 2048.383, so approximate V=12.7 mph. Wait, check: 12.7 mph, but then 12.7 mph is the wind velocity. But wait, check: 12.7 mph is approximate. But let me check: Actually, 12.7 mph is not exactly 2^(11/3)? Let's check: 2^(11/3) = exp((11/3)*ln2)= exp(3.6667 * 0.6931)= exp(2.543)= 12.71 mph. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut let me recast: Pressure P = k A V^3, and given: 4 = k*2*512, so k=4/1024= 1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, so 32= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048. That is answer.\n\nWe can simplify cube root of 2048: 2048= 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8 * cube root of 4 mph. So answer: V=8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a neat final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer: V= cube root of 2048 mph, or approx 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information.\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, the pressure is P = 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity.\nWe are given that P = 32 pounds and A = 4 ft\u00b2. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So formula: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4. So find k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = 1024k. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So we have: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11 (since 2^11=2048). So cube root of 2^11 equals 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*(2^(2/3)). So answer: wind velocity = 8 * cube root of 4, but simpler: V = 8 * (2^(2/3)) mph, but we can also approximate. Alternatively, we can also write: V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can write: V = 8*(cube root of 4) mph. But maybe we can check: 8*(cube root of 4) is approximately 8*1.5874 = 12.699, about 12.70 mph. But it's not a nice number. Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, V = 2048^(1/3) = 12.7 mph approx. But maybe we can simplify further: 2048= 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) mph, which is the exact answer.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3) mph. So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can note that 2^(2/3)= (cube root of 4) mph. So answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph. But then also, check: 8*(cube root of 4) approx 8*1.5874=12.699.

            "solution": "We are given: Pressure P varies jointly as area A and cube of wind velocity V. So we have equation: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, pressure =4 pounds, then k can be computed: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 *512 = k *1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow, question: find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. So using formula: 32 = (1/256)* 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11 because 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 is 8 * cube root of 4? Let's check: Actually, 2048= 8^3? Wait, 8^3=512, not 2048. Let's re-check: 8^3=512, but 16^3=4096, so it's in between. So answer: V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, write as 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). But maybe we want decimal approximate: 2^(2/3)= approximately 1.5874, so product approx 12.6 mph. But I'll leave answer in exact form.\n\nBut wait, check: 2^(11/3) = cube root of 2048. Alternatively, can we simplify? Because 2048 = 2^11, then cube root = 2^(11/3) mph. That is the answer. Alternatively, we can say V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. Or we can express as 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI can check: 2^(11/3)= (2^3)^(11/9)? That is not simpler. Alternatively, I can say V = 2^(11/3) mph. Let me see if we can simplify fraction: 11/3 is not simplified further.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that if V^3=2048, then V=\u221b2048. But I want to check: 2048/8=256, not sure.\n\nI can check: If V=12 mph, then V^3=1728, too small. If V=13 mph, then V^3=2197, too big. So the answer is between 12 and 13 mph, about 12.6 mph. Let me check: cube root of 2048 precisely: using calculator, cube root of 2048= about 12.7 mph maybe. Let me compute: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7*12.7 = (161.29)*12.7= 2048.083, yes.\n\nWait, I'll re-check: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7=161.29, multiplied by 12.7= 2048.083. So yes. But the exact answer is 2^(11/3) mph, which is acceptable.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI must include the answer in a box: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce the answer in the required final answer.

Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3).

            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Let me denote the relationship: P = k * A * V^3. Given P=4, A=2, V=8, then 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So the equation is: P = (1/256) * A * V^3. Now we are given: when A=4, P=32, solve for V: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (32*64) = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4, but that's not a nice integer. Let's check: 8^3=512, 10^3=1000, 11^3=1331, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13, but maybe there is a nice answer? Alternatively, we can solve: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 8* cube root of 4, as we computed. But maybe we can simplify: cube root of 4 = 4^(1/3). Alternatively, we can note that 2048 = 2^11, so cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 4 = cube root of (2^2) = 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can approximate: 2^(2/3) ~ 2^(0.6667)= approx 1.5874, so product is 8*1.5874 = 12.699. So about 12.70 mph. But perhaps they want the exact answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or 16 * cube root of (1/2) mph? Let me check: Actually, 8* cube root of 4 mph. We can also express as 16 * cube root of (1/2) mph? Let's check: cube root of (1/2) = 1/(cube root of 2) = 1/2^(1/3), so 16*(1/2^(1/3)) = 16/2^(1/3) = 8*2^(2/3)? Actually, 16/2^(1/3)=16*2^(-1/3)=8*2^(2/3) yes. So answer is same.\n\nWait, check: 8* cube root of 4 mph is the simplest.\n\nLet me check: Possibly the answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can rationalize: cube root of 4 mph = 4^(1/3) mph. So answer: V = 8 * 4^(1/3) mph.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want a decimal approximation: approx 12.70 mph. But the problem is likely from an algebra course where they want the answer in terms of cube roots. Let me check: \"The pressure P varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k A V^3. Given data: P=4, A=2, V=8, so k = 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then new scenario: P=32, A=4, so 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64=2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 8 cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is the exact answer.\n\nI can simplify cube root of 4 as 2^(2/3) so answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3)= 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nWe can also write it as 8 * cube root of 4 mph. I'll give answer as: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. But I'll check: 8\u221b4 = 8*(4^(1/3)) mph.\n\nI can also check: 4^(1/3) approximately equals 1.5874, multiplied by 8 equals 12.699 mph, which is correct.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll now produce final answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. We'll produce answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. We'll produce final answer. We'll produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer with explanation. We'll produce answer: \"8\u221b4 mph\", which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.

This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1.

Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 256 to eliminate the fraction:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00b7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00b7 256:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00b7 256 = 8192\n\nNow, solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u20034 \u00b7 V\u00b3 = 8192\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192 / 4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Find V by taking the cube root of 2048:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4 (because 4 = 2\u00b2), we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}\n\nFor an approximate value, note that \u221b4 is about 1.587, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.70 mph.",

            "solution": "We are given that pressure P varies jointly as area A and the cube of wind's velocity V. That means P = k A V^3 for some constant k. We are given: when V=8 mph, A=2 sq ft, P=4 pounds. So we solve: 4 = k * 2 * (8)^3 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find V when A=4, P=32: so 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Now find cube root: cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) is not an integer. Alternatively, note that 2048 = 8^3? Wait, check: 8^3 = 512, not 2048. 16^3 = 4096, so no. So answer is V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). We can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can write approximate value: 2^(2/3) approx equals 1.5874, times 8 equals 12.699, so approximately 12.7 mph. But maybe we want an exact answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can express as 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Let me check: Actually, check: cube of (8 * 2^(2/3)) equals 512 * 2^(2) equals 512*4 = 2048. So yes. But maybe a simpler expression: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But that's not simpler. Let me check: Actually, cube root of 4 is the same as 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8* cube root of 4 mph, or V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: wind velocity is cube root of (32*64/4)? Wait, I'll recompute: Given equation: 32 = k * 4 * V^3, and k = 1/256, so 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). That is the answer.\n\nLet's check: 2^(11/3) mph. We can also express that as 2^(3+2/3)=8 *2^(2/3) mph, which is approximately 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699 mph approx. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can simplify: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3) mph. That is the exact answer.\n\nThus answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph.

Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003Now, when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P is jointly proportional to area A and cube of velocity V. So: P = k A V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4. So find constant k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 =512. So k=4 / (2*512) = 4 /1024 = 1/256. So then P = (A V^3)/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when pressure is 32, sail area=4. So equation: 32 = (4 V^3)/256 => Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4 V^3, compute: 32*256 =8192? Let's check: 32*256 =8192, then divide by 4: V^3=8192/4=2048. So find V: V = cube root of 2048. Factor: 2048 = 2^? 2048= 2^11? Actually, 2^11=2048. So cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But that is not a nice integer. Let me check: maybe I did something wrong. Let's check: 8 mph gives P=4 for A=2. That gives k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. So then for A=4, P=32, equation: 32 = (4 * V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4 V^3, 32*256 =8192, so V^3=8192/4=2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^11. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). That is not a nice integer. Let me check if maybe the problem expects answer in terms of radical or maybe we can simplify: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer is V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can simplify further: 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, cube root of 2048 is 12.7 mph approx. Let me compute: cube root of 2048 is approx: 12.7 mph. But maybe the answer expects a fractional expression. Let me check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. But let me check: 8*2^(2/3)=8* (approx 1.5874)=12.699 mph approx. Alternatively, we can write answer: V= 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWait, I must check if the problem expects an answer as an exact expression or maybe we can simplify further: 8\u221b4 mph is acceptable.\n\nWait, let me re-read the question: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph. Alternatively, if we want to express in terms of radical: 8\u221b4 mph. But let me check: Actually, we can simplify: 2^(2/3)= (4)^(1/3) so answer: V=8*(4)^(1/3) mph. Alternatively, V= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, maybe we can simplify: 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can rationalize: Let x = cube root of 4. So answer: 8x mph. Alternatively, we can express as: 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can also express as: V= 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can express as: V = 2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). There's no simpler expression.\n\nI can check: (8*2^(2/3))^3 = 8^3 * 2^2 =512*4=2048, correct.\n\nSo answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 8 mph gives 4 pounds, 16 mph gives 128 pounds? Let's test: if A=2, then P = (2*16^3)/256 = (2*4096)/256=8192/256=32, so yes.\n\nNow, let me check: Possibly the constant is misinterpreted: \"varies jointly as\" means P = k A V^3. So that's correct.\n\nSo answer: V=8\u221b4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me re-read the question: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So indeed, P = k A V^3. So answer: V=8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI can also solve: V^3 = (P*256)/A. For given P=32, A=4, then V^3 = (32*256)/4= (32*256)/4 =32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify: 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nMaybe we can simplify further: cube root of 4 is not rational.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. I'll include step-by-step explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer in box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, we have\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 256 to eliminate the fraction:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 256:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192\n\nNow, the equation is:\n\u2003\u20038192 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192 / 4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express this as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2\u00b2 (which is 4), we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}",

Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, then P=4 pounds. So we can find constant k: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So the formula becomes: P = (1/256)* A * V^3.\n\nNow we want: find V when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3. Multiply both sides: 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048: 2^11. So V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8* 2^(2/3). But maybe we want a decimal approx. But maybe they want an exact answer: V = 8 * cube root(4)? Let's check: 2^(2/3) = cube root(2^2)= cube root(4). So answer: V = 8 cube root(4) mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate: cube root(4) ~ 1.5874, times 8 gives about 12.699 mph. But the question likely expects: wind velocity = 8 * cube root(4) mph, or maybe simplified as 8 * cube root(4) mph. Let me check: 8* cube root(4) mph is the answer. But let me check: 2^(11/3)= (2^(3))*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can write: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer is: wind velocity = 8 * cube root(4) mph. Alternatively, 2^(11/3) mph. Let me check: 2^(11/3)= (2^11)^(1/3)= (2048)^(1/3) = cube root of 2048.

So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V=8 * 2^(2/3) mph. That is the answer. Alternatively, we can express as V=8 * cube root(4) mph.

When velocity is 8 mph, pressure is 4 pounds for sail area 2 square feet. So 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nThen find wind velocity when pressure is 32 pounds for sail area 4 square feet. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Now compute cube root: cube root of 2048 equals? Let's see: 2048= 2^11. Cube root: (2^11)^(1/3)=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3) approximate value: 2^(2/3)= approx 1.5874. Then product= 8*1.5874=12.699. But maybe the answer is exactly expressed in radical form: V = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe they want a simplified answer. But let me check: maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11). Alternatively, we can write as: V = 8 * cube root of 4? Because 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2= cube root of 4. So answer: V= 8 cube root of 4 mph. But maybe they want a decimal approximate: V ~ 12.7 mph. But wait check: V^3 = 2048, then cube root of 2048: Let me check: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so indeed 12.7 mph. But wait: 8 cube root of 4 = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699. But is that the answer? Let's check: pressure = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3) ~? Let's check: 12.7^3 approx = 2048? yes.\n\nBut I want to see if there is an integer answer: maybe the answer is exactly 8* cube root of 4 mph.

For given A=4, P=32, so equation: 32= (4 V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256: 32*256= 4 V^3, so V^3= (32*256)/4= (32*64)= 2048, so V= cube root of 2048. Yes.\n\nI can also simplify: 2048= 2^11, so V= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3).

Use k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are given that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we need to find V. Substitute into the formula:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply 4 by 1/256:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nNow, solve for V\u00b3 by multiplying both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Find V by taking the cube root of 2048:\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 \u221b(4)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate value, note that \u221b4 is about 1.587, so\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}",

            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" \n\nWe have relationship: P = k * A * V^3. We can solve for k using given data: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 =512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow use second condition: P=32, A=4, unknown V. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, then simplify: 4/256 = 1/64, so equation becomes: 32 = (1/64) * V^3, multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32 * 64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11, because 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 equals 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But we want a number. Alternatively, we can find approximate: cube root of 2048 is approximately? Let's compute: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But we can simplify exactly: V = 2^(11/3). Alternatively, we can see: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) which is not an integer. Alternatively, we can solve exactly: V = cube root of 2048. Let me check: 2048 = 16 * 128, no, that's not simpler. Alternatively, note: 8 * 2^(2/3) is the simplest form. Alternatively, if we want decimal approximate: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, which is about 1.5874, times 8 equals 12.699, so approximately 12.70 mph. But maybe answer in exact form: 2^(11/3) mph. But let me check: 2^(11/3) mph is exactly equal to 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can also write V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want simplest form: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me double-check: V^3 = 2048, cube root of 2048 equals 2048^(1/3) = 2^(11/3) mph. So answer.\n\nI'll provide answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ miles per hour}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with explanation.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003Substitute these into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince (8)\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 miles per hour\n\nFor an approximate numerical value:\n\u2003\u2003\u221b4 \u2248 1.5874, so\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nThe final answer is:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}",

So we have 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). Now 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So we have: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so solve for V. Multiply: 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, then multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3, i.e. 2048 = V^3. So V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10 = 1024, 2^11 = 2048, so V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can compute cube root of 2048 exactly: cube root of 2048 = 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3 approximates 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048? Actually, let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7 = 161.29, times 12.7 equals 2047.83, which is close to 2048. But the exact answer is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph. However, let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66667) = e^(3.66667 * ln2) = e^(2.54) = 12.7. So answer: wind velocity is cube root of 2048 mph. But we can simplify: 2^(11/3) mph = 8*2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: Actually, note that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, so answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph. But let me check: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, then times 8 gives 12.6992 mph. So answer: Approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: V = cube root of (32 * 256 /4)? Let's recalc: Actually, let me re-check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4 V^3, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or 2^(11/3) mph. That is the answer.\n\nThus final answer: wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3 for some constant k.\n\nGiven: When velocity is 8 mph, pressure is 4 lbs, area is 2 ft^2. So plug in: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. So constant k = 1/256.\n\nNow we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So use: 32 = (1/256)* 4 * V^3. So solve for V. Multiply: 4 * V^3 / 256 = V^3 / 64. So equation: 32 = V^3 / 64. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then find cube root of 2048. Factor: 2048 = 2^? Actually, 2048 = 2^11. Because 2^10=1024, so 2^11=2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4. So V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want a decimal approximate. Alternatively, we can compute cube root of 2048. Alternatively, note that 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so V is between 12 and 13 mph. But wait, check: 8 * cube root of 4. Actually, cube root of 4 is approx 1.5874, so 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699. But let's check: 12.699^3? Actually, let me compute precisely: cube root of 2048 = 2048^(1/3). But maybe we want exact expression. But the problem likely expects answer: V = cube root of 2048 = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Let's check: 8^3 = 512, then 4^3 = 64, product equals 512*64=32768, no. Let me recompute: 2^(11/3) is the simplest expression. Alternatively, express as 2^(11/3) mph. But note: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or about 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let's check: Actually, 2^(2/3) equals cube root of 4, yes.\n\nWe can also express as: V = (32*64)^(1/3) = (2048)^(1/3). So answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph.\n\nI can compute: cube root of 2048. 2^(11/3) is the exact answer. Let me compute approximate value: 2^(11/3) = exp((11/3)*ln2) = exp(11/3*0.693147) = exp(2.541) = 12.69 mph approx.\n\nThus final answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce final answer as: V = 2^(11/3) mph, or about 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}. We'll produce final answer in a neat explanation.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}.\n\nI'll produce answer in text.

This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1.

Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lbs:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048, so\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nFor an approximate value, note that \u221b4 \u2248 1.587, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\nThe final answer is:\u2003\\boxed{12.7\\ \\text{mph (approximately)}}.",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So the formula is: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when velocity is 8 mph, area is 2 square feet, pressure is 4 pounds. So: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = 1024k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Next, find velocity when pressure is 32 pounds and area is 4 square feet. So 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3. That is: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048. Then V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)? Wait, check: 2^11 = 2048, then cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). But we can also check: 8^3 =512, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's not a whole number. Wait, but maybe it is a whole number? Let's recalc: 32 = (1/64)*V^3 => V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, and cube root of 2048 =? Let's check: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But perhaps the problem expects an exact answer in radical form. Alternatively, maybe we made a mistake: Let's re-read: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4, so 4= k * 2 * 512 = 1024k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3, i.e., 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3). We can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3+2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want decimal approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so velocity is about 8*1.5874= 12.699 mph, which is about 12.7 mph. But the problem might be expecting an exact answer in radical form. But wait, maybe we misinterpret: \"cube of the wind's velocity\" means V^3, so that's what we did.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). But that is not a nice integer. Let's check: 2^(11/3) is not integer because 11 is not divisible by 3. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer as \"2^(11/3)\" mph or \"8 * 2^(2/3)\" mph. But maybe the problem expects a simplified radical form. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a numeric approximation: \"Approximately 12.7 mph.\" But the problem is from a typical algebra joint variation problem, so probably they want an exact answer in simplest radical form. Let's see: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3)*2^(2/3)= 2^3*2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of (2^2)= 8* cube root of 4 mph.\n\nSo answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph. But wait, let me double-check: 32 = (1/64)* V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, cube root of 2048 =? 2^11 = 2048, so cube root = 2^(11/3)= 2^3 *2^(2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root(4). Yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= (2^(1/3))^2, but that doesn't simplify further. So answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nLet's check if there's a possibility that the joint variation constant might be computed as: k = P/(A V^3) = 4/(2*512)= 4/1024= 1/256, so then for the second scenario: 32 = (1/256)*4* V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64= 2048, yes.\n\nThus answer: V = cube root (2048) mph, which is 8 cube root (4) mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph, or approximately \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a final message.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a final message: \"Answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce final answer in a final message.

Use given: when V=8, A=2, P=4, then 4 = k * 2 * 8^3, so k = 4/(2*512) = 4/(1024) = 1/256. So k=1/256.\n\nNow find V when A=4, P=32, so equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 V^3, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (8192)/4 = 2048. Wait check: Actually 32*256 = 8192, then 8192/4=2048. So V^3 = 2048. But 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^11=2048, yes. So V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can express it as 8*(cube root of 4). But is that answer acceptable? Let's check: Alternatively, we can compute cube root of 2048. But maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*(2^(2/3)). But maybe we want a decimal approximate value. Alternatively, we can also solve: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7? Let's check: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But is the answer expected in radical form? Alternatively, we can write V = 8* cube root of 4. But wait, check: 8*(cube root of 4) = 8* (cube root of 4). But wait, cube root of 4 = 4^(1/3) and 8=2^3, so that equals 2^(3+2/3)=2^(11/3). Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify further? 2^(11/3)= 2^(9/3+2/3)=2^3*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). That is the exact answer. Alternatively, if we want a decimal, approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, then times 8 is about 12.6992 mph. But the problem likely expects an exact answer: V=8* cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: Wait, check: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8*(cube root of 4) mph. That is the answer.\n\nWait, let me re-check: k=1/256, then for new condition: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (8192)/4=2048, so V = cube root of 2048. 2048= 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph or 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now provide final answer.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce answer in final message with final answer in box.

            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Let me check: Variation: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when V=8, A=2, P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now we want: find V when A=4, P=32, using formula: 32 = (1/256)*4* V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. So then V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * cube root of 2^2 = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can check: cube root of 2048 approximates: 12.7? Let's check: 12.7^3=12.7^3= about 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7*12.7= 2048. So answer: V = 12.7 mph approximated? Let's compute precisely: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * (cube root of 4). So answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait, check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, so answer is exactly that. Alternatively, we can simplify: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we want a decimal approximation. Let me compute: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, times 8 is 12.6992 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph. But the answer should be in exact form: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait: Let me check the given: \"varies jointly as A and the cube of V\". So P = k A V^3. So using given: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for A=4, P=32: 32 = (1/256)*4* V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. So answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nI can also simplify: 8 cube root of 4 mph.

This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003Substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Find V by taking the cube root of 2048:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2\u00b2 (which is 4), we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nSo, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 mph\n\nFor an approximate numerical value, note that \u221b4 is about 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}",

            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So relationship: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So then: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then for pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds, find wind velocity V such that: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute cube root of 2048. Factor: 2048=2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V^3 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3). That is not an integer. Let's check: cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we can simplify further: Actually, let's compute approximate value: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, multiplied by 8 gives about 12.6992 mph. But maybe they want answer in radical form: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or 2^(11/3) mph, or maybe we can check if we made error: Let's check: 4 square feet, V= ? using P= (1/256)*4*V^3 = (V^3)/64, so P=32 => V^3 = 2048. Factor: 2048=8^3=512? Wait, check: 8^3=512, not 2048. So V= cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11, so V=2^(11/3) mph. But maybe it can be simplified: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3)=8* cube root of 4. That is the answer.\n\nWait, let's check: cube root of 4 is about 1.587, multiplied by 8 gives 12.7 mph approx.\n\nWait, but check: Alternatively, maybe we can use ratio: P1/A1/V^3 = constant, but then P2= k * A2 * V^3, so ratio: P1/P2 = (A1*V1^3)/(A2*V2^3). Solve for V2. But anyway.\n\nI must check: Given P= k A V^3, with k=1/256. For second scenario: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048. So V= cube root of 2048. 2^(11/3)=8*2^(2/3) = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph.

            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant of proportionality.\n\nGiven: When V=8, A=2, then P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we have new conditions: P=32, A=4, find V. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = (4/256) V^3 = (1/64) V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor: 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11=2048. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8 * cube root of 4. But that's not a nice number. Wait, maybe we can simplify further: Actually, let's check: 2^11 = 2048. Cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4, but it's not a nice number. Alternatively, we can solve V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. But perhaps we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * cube root of 2^(2)=8 * cube root of 4. That is not a nice integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can check: 8^3=512, 9^3=729, 10^3=1000, 11^3=1331, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197. So 2048 is not a perfect cube. So answer is V = cube root of 2048 mph. But we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe we can express as 8* cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want a decimal approximation: cube root of 2048 \u2248 12.7 mph? Let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 2048? Actually, 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = (12.7*12.7=161.29) *12.7 = 2048.383, so yes, about 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let's check: Actually, 12.7^3 ~ 2048, yes.\n\nBut wait, let's re-check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => (4/256) = 1/64, so equation becomes V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So yes.\n\nThus answer: V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8*cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, check: Let's check the units: The pressure is in pounds, area in square feet, velocity in mph. But it's fine.\n\nI think the answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph, or about 12.7 mph.\n\nI will now check the steps:\n\nGiven: P = k A V^3, with k constant. Given: 4 = k*2*8^3 = k*2*512 = k*1024, so k=4/1024=1/256.\n\nThen for new conditions: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64=2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8 cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer in text: \"The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce answer in text: \"The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph.\"\n\nI'll produce answer in final answer box.\n\nI'll produce answer with final answer in box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer with final answer in text: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given information:\n\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003Substitute k, A, and P into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express this as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8\u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nIf you need a decimal approximation, note that:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u221b4 \u2248 1.5874, so V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.6992 mph\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

Given: When V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, and P=4 pounds. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So k = 1/256.\n\nNow we want: find the wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. So 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, because 4/256 = 1/64. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Solve V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V^3=2^11. So V = 2^(11/3). But maybe we want to simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want a decimal approximation. 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4) mph. Alternatively, if we want to compute cube root of 2048. Alternatively, if we want a decimal approximation: cube root of 2048 is approx? Let's compute: cube root of 2048 = exp( (1/3)*ln(2048) ) = exp( (1/3)*(ln(2048) )). But easier: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so V is between 12 and 13 mph. But the exact answer is V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait check: 8*(cube root of 4) mph, is that correct? Let's check: (8 * cube root of 4)^3 = 512 * 4 = 2048, yes. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut also note that the problem is from a textbook, so probably answer in terms of radicals: V = 8 * 4^(1/3) mph, or simplified as 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can find cube root of 2048 exactly: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*(cube root of 4). So answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4) mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4) mph. Alternatively, we can approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so V ~ 12.699 mph approx.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph. We'll put answer in box. We'll put final answer in box.

This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb:\nSubstitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

And cube root of 2048 equals cube root of (2^11) equals 2^(11/3)=2^(3.666...)= approx 12.7 mph. But maybe we can simplify to 8 * cube root of 4? Let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(9/3 + 2/3)=2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8 * cube root of 2^2=8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8 * 256) = 2 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of (2^8)=2 * 2^(8/3)=2^(11/3) same thing.\n\nWait, I'll check: Actually, maybe I'll simplify: V = cube root (2048)= cube root (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3)=8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut maybe it's easier: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => V^3 = 32 * (256/4)=32*64=2048. So V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. But I'll check: 12.7^3 approximates to 2048, yes.\n\nWe can also express as: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8 * 1.5874 approx = 12.699, so correct.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with explanation. We'll produce final answer with explanation: \"The pressure is given by P = k A V^3. Using the given data, we find k = 1/256. Then plugging in the new conditions: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= 8 cube root of 4 mph.\" So answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer accordingly.\n\nI'll produce final answer. We'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer. We'll produce final answer. We'll produce answer in text. We'll produce final answer. We'll produce answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given data:\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, the pressure P = 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are given that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we need to find V. Substitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nNow solve for V\u00b3 by multiplying both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Take the cube root of both sides to solve for V:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u221b(2\u00b2) = 8 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u221b4 mph\n\nSo the final answer is: \n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So the relationship: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Then we have given: when velocity V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, P=4 pounds. So substitute: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). But 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 *512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So constant k= 1/256.\n\nNow we want: find wind velocity when pressure is 32 pounds on 4 square feet. So use formula: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, solve for V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3, so 8192 = 4*V^3, then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. Now we need cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11 because 2^11 = 2048, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) but wait let me check: Actually, 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But maybe we want approximate value or simplified radical? Let's check: Actually, cube root of 2048 is not an integer. Alternatively, we can write it as: V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But if we want a decimal, 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4 approx. 1.5874, so V approx = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But maybe it expects answer in radical form. Alternatively, we can solve it exactly: V = cube root(2048) = cube root(2^11) = 2^(11/3). That is acceptable.\n\nBut maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * cube root(4). So answer: V = 8 * cube root(4) mph. But then check: 8 * cube root(4) = 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But wait, check if that is correct: Let's recompute: k=1/256, then P= (1/256)*4*V^3, so P= (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so 32= (1/64)*V^3 => V^3=32*64=2048, so yes.\n\nBut the question says \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = cube root(2048) mph = 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nBut wait, check: 2^(11/3) is not exactly 12.7 mph, it's 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) approx = e^(3.6666 * ln2) = e^(2.539) approx = 12.66 mph. Wait, let me recalc: ln2=0.693, so 3.6666*0.693 = 2.54, e^(2.54)=12.7 mph. So yes.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 cube root(4) mph or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, but let me check: 8* cube root(4) = 8 * 4^(1/3) = 8 * (cube root of 4) = 8 * (approx 1.5874) = 12.6992 mph approx. So answer: about 12.7 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve for cube root exactly: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). That is acceptable answer.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer.\n\nI'll produce answer in a final answer box: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph} \\text{ (approximately 12.7 mph)}}.\n\nI'll produce answer accordingly.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb, substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Solve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis is the exact value of the wind velocity. To express it in a slightly different form:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we can also write:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nStep 4. Approximate the value:\n\u2003\u2003\u221b4 \u2248 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.6992 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ mph, which is approximately } 12.7 \\text{ mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant of proportionality.\n\nGiven: when V = 8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P = 4 lbs. So plug: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find wind velocity when P = 32, A = 4. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Let's see: 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11 = 2048, but cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want to find exact value: V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 approx? Let's check: cube root of 2048 is exactly 2048^(1/3). We can simplify: 2048=2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait check: 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, so V = 2048^(1/3). Let's compute approximate: cube root of 2048 is approximately 12.7 mph. But maybe we want an exact expression: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we want to check: is that what is required? The problem statement: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph. Let me check: 2^11 = 2048, cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) approximates 12.7 mph. But wait, check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 1.6 = 12.8 mph, but I'll compute more precisely: cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph. Let me compute exactly: 12.7^3 = 12.7^3 = 2048.383? Actually I'll compute exactly: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048.383, so that's close enough.\n\nWait, but the problem probably expects an exact answer. Let me check the relation: P = k * A * V^3, k = 1/256. Then for given P=32, A=4, equation becomes: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256) V^3 = (1/64)V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, and then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify: 2^(2/3)= (cube root of 4). So answer: V=8 cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want to express answer as: V=8 cube root of 4 mph. But let me check: The cube root of 4 is not a nice number. Perhaps we can leave answer as cube root of 2048 mph.\n\nI can also check: 2^(11/3) mph. That is the simplest exact form. Alternatively, if we want a decimal: approximately 12.7 mph. But the problem likely expects an exact answer.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}.\n\nWait, but I need to check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1.

Use k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the right side:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64.\n\u2003\u2003So, 32 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048.\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have P = k * A * V^3. We are given: when velocity is 8 mph, pressure is 4 pounds, and sail area is 2 square feet. So P = 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So equation: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now next: find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So we have: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. Solve for V^3: multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 * V^3. So 32 * 256 = 8192? Let's check: 32 * 256 = 8192. So equation: 8192 = 4 * V^3, then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. So then V = cube root of 2048. Now factor 2048: 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10 = 1024, 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) which is not a nice integer. Alternatively, we can solve: V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = 2 * cube root of 256? Not exactly. Let's check: Actually, 2048 = 8 * 256 = 8 * 256, but cube root of 8 is 2, so V = 2 * cube root of 256, but 256 is 2^8, so cube root of 256 = 2^(8/3) = 2^(2 + 2/3) = 4 * 2^(2/3)? That is not simpler.\n\nWait, let me recalc: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). That is not an integer. But maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity = 8 * cube root of 4? Actually 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, but that doesn't simplify to a nice number. Let's check: Actually, 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4, so answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph. But perhaps we can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = (2^(1/3))^11, no that's not simpler.\n\nWait, let me re-check the arithmetic: P = (1/256) * A * V^3. When A=2, V=8, then V^3 = 512, and 2*512 =1024, times (1/256) equals 1024/256 =4, which is correct. For second scenario, A=4, P=32, so equation becomes: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = 32*64 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) mph. That is the answer. Let's see if we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately? Let's compute approximate value: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8*1.5874=12.699. Let me check: 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approximately. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph. However, the problem might expect an exact answer in radical form: V = 8 * \u221b4 mph, or V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nLet me check if the answer is exactly 2^(11/3) mph. But wait, 2^(11/3) is not a nice number. Alternatively, we can write it as 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI can simplify further: 2^(11/3) mph is the simplest exact form. Alternatively, if we want a decimal approximation, it's about 12.7 mph.\n\nLet me check: V^3 = 2048, cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2048. 12.7^3 = 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = maybe approximate 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 = 161.29, times 12.7 = 2048.383, which is nearly 2048. So yes.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph or 8\u221b4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, but wait: The problem said \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" I must check: The pressure is 32 pounds, area is 4, so equation: 32 = k * 4 * V^3, k=1/256, so 32= (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, same.\n\nThus answer: V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph. I can also write it as 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nThus final answer: wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or 8\u221b4 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus I'll output: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. But maybe I'll say: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph, which is the exact answer.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{2^{11/3}} mph. But I'll check: Actually, 2^(11/3) mph is equal to 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, which is the same as 8\u221b4 mph. So I'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer with explanation.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind\u2019s velocity V. This means that\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nNow, when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we have:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nMultiply both sides by 256 to eliminate the fraction:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 256:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192\nSo,\n\u2003\u20038192 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192/4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\nNotice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\nThis can also be written as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nThus, the wind velocity is exactly\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}.",

When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" \n\nWe have: P = k A V^3. Given: P = 4, A = 2, V = 8, so 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then we use new: P = 32, A = 4, unknown V. Then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) but we need to find a simpler value. Wait check: cube root of 2048 = 12.7? Wait recalc: 8^3 = 512, 9^3 = 729, 10^3=1000, 11^3=1331, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so 2048 is between 12 and 13, not a nice integer. But maybe we can simplify: 2048 = 2^11. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can say V = 8 * cube root of 4? Let me check: Actually, 2048 = 64*32? Let me recalc: 32*64 = 2048, so V^3=32*64, but that doesn't simplify. Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) which is the answer.\n\nWait: But maybe the problem expects a numerical answer. Let me check: The problem states: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4? Let's check: Actually, let's recalc: 2048 = 2^11 = 2^(9+2) = 512*4 = 2048. Wait, I'm trying to express cube root in simpler form: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2^2, which is cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 4 is not an integer. Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3). But wait, let me check: Actually, 8^3 = 512, 9^3 = 729, 10^3=1000, 11^3=1331, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197. So 2048 is not a perfect cube. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, then multiplied by 8 gives about 12.699 mph, approximately 12.7 mph. But let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 is exactly 8 * 4^(1/3). Alternatively, we can express it as 2^(11/3). Which is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve the equation: (1/256)*4*V^3=32, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) mph. But wait, 2^(11/3) is not a nice number. Let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) which is about 12.7 mph. But wait, did we get 4*V^3/256=32? Multiply both sides by 256: 4V^3 = 32*256=8192, so V^3=8192/4=2048, same result.\n\nThus answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph. But wait, check: 8 mph is given, then pressure on 2 sq ft is 4 pounds. So if we double the area to 4, then pressure doubles to 8 pounds if velocity remains same. But then to get 32 pounds, we need 4 times the pressure, so V^3 must be 4 times bigger, so V must be cube root of 4 times bigger than 8 mph, which is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is consistent with our answer.\n\nLet me check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph is approximately 8*1.5874=12.699 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: V \u2248 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, check: Actually, 8 * cube root of 4 mph is exactly the same as 2^(3)*2^(2/3)=2^(11/3). So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, V = 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer in final message.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So that means: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nWe are given: when V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4 pounds. So then k = P/(A * V^3) = 4 / (2 * 8^3) = 4 / (2 * 512) = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we want: when A=4 ft^2, P=32 pounds, find V. So we have 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 * V^3. But 32*256 = 8192, but let's check: 256 * 32 = 8192. So equation becomes: 8192 = 4 * V^3, then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. But note: 2048 = 2^11. Actually 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)? Wait: 11/3 = 3 + 2/3, so V = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. But we can also check: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) which is not a whole number. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer in radical form. But wait, maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. But we can also compute approximate: 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so V ~ 8*1.5874 = 12.699 mph, about 12.7 mph. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer: \"8*2^(2/3)\" mph.\n\nLet's check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, so answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But wait, maybe we can find a nicer form: Let x = cube root of 4 mph, so answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 8 * (4)^(1/3) mph.\n\nLet's check: using our constant: k = 1/256, then P = (1/256)*A*V^3, so for A=4 and P=32, then V^3 = (32*256)/4 = 8192/4 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, which is the exact answer.\n\nWe can also check: (2^(2/3)) ~ 1.5874, so V ~ 12.699 mph. But perhaps the answer is expected as an exact expression: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI check: cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. Let me check: 12.7^3 = 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7 = 12.7^2 = 161.29, times 12.7 = 2048.383, so yes.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph. But let me check: Actually, 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But wait: cube root of 4 is not 2^(2/3) but same. So answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nWait, but then check: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8* (4^(1/3)) mph. But note: 4^(1/3) is not the same as 2^(2/3)? Yes, they are the same because 4 = 2^2, so 4^(1/3) = 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nWe can also express it as V = 2^(11/3) mph. But I think it's simplest to say: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also check: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8 * (cube root of 4) mph. But I can check: 4^(1/3) ~ 1.5874, so product ~ 12.699 mph. That is the answer.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph. Wait, check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph is the answer.\n\nI can also express it as: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in final message.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 256 to eliminate the fraction:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 256:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192\n\nSo:\n\u2003\u20038192 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192 / 4 = 2048\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So the equation is: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft^2, then P = 4 lb. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). But 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So we have: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32 * 256 = 4 * V^3. But 32*256 = 8192, so 8192 = 4 * V^3, so V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But we want a simplified answer. Alternatively, 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: Alternatively, we can find an integer if possible? Actually, 2048 is not a perfect cube. But maybe we can express as cube root of 2048. But wait: Let's check: 8^3 = 512, 16^3 = 4096, so answer is between 8 and 16 mph. But we got V = cube root of 2048 = approx? Let's check: cube root of 2048. 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so it's between 12 and 13 mph. But wait, let's check: Actually, I need to re-check: We had: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3. 32*256 = 8192, then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. So yes. Now cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further? Possibly the answer is best expressed as 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or we can approximate. Alternatively, we can express it as 2^(11/3). The question might be from a contest or math problem, so maybe they want an exact answer in simplest radical form. We can write: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can write: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Because 2^(2/3) = cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want a decimal approximation: cube root of 4 is approx 1.5874, then times 8 gives 12.699, so approx 12.70 mph.\n\nLet's check: Alternatively, we can try to see if the given numbers are consistent. Let me check: For V=8 mph, pressure=4. For V=12.7 mph, pressure = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3). But 12.7^3 is around 2048, then 4/256=0.015625, times 2048 equals 32. So yes.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or equivalently 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nWe can check: 8 mph cube gives 512, multiplied by 2 gives 1024, constant is 1/256, so pressure is 4. Then for 4 square feet, wind velocity V must satisfy: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so V = cube root of 2048. So yes.\n\nThus final answer: V = cube root of 2048 = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. I'll now produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a boxed environment: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce explanation: The pressure P is given by P = kAV^3, find k, then substitute new values.\n\nI'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer. We'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k.\nWe are given that when V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, the pressure P is 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, this becomes:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant to find the new wind velocity.\nNow, we need to find V when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds. Substitute these values and k into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 256 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 256:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 256 = 8192\n\nSo we have:\n\n\u2003\u20038192 = 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 8192 / 4 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V.\nWe need to take the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2. Since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nRecognize that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2\u00b2, which is the cube root of 4.

            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe can denote the relation: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when V = 8 mph, A = 2, then P = 4. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. So the formula is: P = (1/256)*A*V^3.\n\nWe want to find V when A = 4 and P = 32. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4*V^3. So 8192 = 4*V^3, hence V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11 = 2048. But wait, check: 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). But that doesn't simplify nicely. Let me check: maybe we can simplify further: Actually, let me check: 8^3 = 512, 9^3=729, 10^3=1000, etc. Wait, no, 8 mph was given. Let's recalc: k = 4/(2*512)= 4/1024= 1/256. So then the equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32=4/256 * V^3= (1/64)*V^3, then multiply both sides by 64: 32*64= V^3, 32*64= 2048, so V^3= 2048, so V= cube root of 2048. But cube root of 2048 is not an integer. Let's check: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But let me check if the problem expects a fractional answer: But wait, the given values: when V=8 mph, P=4, then with 4 square feet and P=32, then V should be bigger. But 8 mph is less than 12 mph, so answer is 8? That doesn't seem consistent. Let's recalc: The relation is P \u221d A*V^3, so if we double the area, then pressure doubles for same V. And if we want to double pressure from 4 to 32, that's an 8 times increase, so V should be cube root of 8 = 2 times bigger than the original velocity. So if V=8 mph originally, then 2 times bigger is 16 mph. But wait, check: Actually, if we double the area from 2 to 4, the pressure doubles, so to get from 4 to 32, that's an 8 times increase in pressure, so V^3 must be 8 times bigger, so V must be 2 times bigger than 8 mph, which is 16 mph. Let's check: P = (1/256)*4*(16^3). 16^3=4096, so (1/256)*4*4096= (4/256)*4096= (1/64)*4096= 64, not 32. That doesn't match. Wait, let's recalc: Let's re-read the problem carefully: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So P = k*A*V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, and A=2, then P=4. So we get: 4 = k*2*(8^3) = k*2*512= k*1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find V when A=4, P=32: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, and V = cube root of 2048. Now cube root of 2048 is not 16. Let's check: 16^3 = 4096, so it's half that, so cube root of 2048 is 16/ (2^(1/3)? Wait, let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is not 16. Let me check: 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so V approx equals 8*1.5874 = 12.699. That is about 12.7 mph. But wait, then check: if V=12.7 mph, then V^3 approx equals 2048, then P approx equals (1/256)*4*2048 = (4/256)*2048 = (1/64)*2048 = 32, so it's consistent.\n\nBut wait, there's another way: The relation is P \u221d A V^3. So if we double A, then P doubles for same V. So to get from 4 to 32, that's an 8 times increase in pressure. So V^3 must be 8 times bigger, so V must be 2 times bigger. So then V should be 16 mph if the area were the same as the original. But here the area is doubled, so the increase in pressure is not solely due to velocity change. Let's do it systematically:\n\nLet initial condition: P1 = k*A1*V1^3 = k*2*8^3 = k*2*512 = k*1024 = 4, so k=4/1024=1/256.\n\nNow new condition: P2 = k*A2*V2^3 = (1/256)*4*V2^3 = (4/256)*V2^3 = (1/64)*V2^3 = 32. Multiply both sides by 64: V2^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V2 = cube root of 2048. 2048= 2^11, so V2 = 2^(11/3). 2^(11/3) is not a nice integer. Let's simplify: 2^(11/3)= 2^(9/3+2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, approximate: 2^(2/3) \u2248 1.5874, so V \u2248 8*1.5874 = 12.699 mph, about 12.7 mph.\n\nBut let me check: if the wind velocity is 12.7 mph, then the pressure on 4 square feet is: P = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3). Let's check approximate: 12.7^3 approximates 12.7*12.7*12.7= 2048? Wait, 12.7^3 approximates 2048 exactly because we solved that earlier. So yes, that works.\n\nWait, but the earlier reasoning \"if we double the area, then pressure doubles, so to get from 4 to 32, that's an 8 times increase, so V must be 2 times bigger\" is not valid because the relationship is not directly proportional to V^3? Let's re-read: \"varies jointly as the area of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity.\" That means P \u221d A V^3. So if we double A, then for same V, pressure doubles. So if we want pressure to be 8 times larger than before (4 to 32 is an 8 times increase), then if we had kept area constant at 2, then V^3 must be 8 times larger, so V would be 2 times bigger, i.e. 16 mph. But here A is doubled (4 instead of 2), so the combined effect is: new pressure = (2*V^3) compared to old pressure with area 2. Wait, let's reframe: Let initial condition be: P \u221d A*V^3. For the initial condition, let the constant be k. So P1 = k*2*8^3 = k*1024 = 4, so k= 1/256. For the new condition, with A=4, we want P2 = 32. Then P2 = (1/256)*4*V2^3 = (1/64)*V2^3. Set equal to 32: V2^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So V2 = cube root of 2048. Now, compare with the scenario if we had kept area constant at 2 and increased velocity: P would be (1/256)*2*V^3. To get P=32, we require (1/256)*2*V^3 = 32, so V^3 = 32*256/2 = 32*128 = 4096, so V = cube root of 4096 = cube root of 2^12 = 2^(12/3)=2^4=16 mph. So indeed, if the area had remained 2, then the velocity needed would be 16 mph. But here the area is doubled, so the required velocity is lower. Let's compute: V2 = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (4096/2) = cube root of 4096 divided by cube root of 2 = 16 / cube root of 2 = 16 / 2^(1/3)= 16 / 2^(1/3). And 16/2^(1/3)= 16*2^(-1/3)= 2^4*2^(-1/3)= 2^(4 - 1/3)= 2^(11/3) which is what we had. And that equals 2^(11/3) mph. And 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, so that equals about 12.7 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8*2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI must present final answer in a box: \\boxed{8\\cdot2^{2/3}} mph, or \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph (approximately)}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.

When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Let's denote the constant of proportionality as k. The formula: P = k * A * V^3. Given that when V=8, A=2, then P=4. So we get: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now, for the second scenario, we have A=4, P=32, and unknown V. So: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Now find cube root: V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11 because 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 equals 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) = (cube root of 4). But maybe it's better to express as cube root of 2048. Alternatively, note that 2048 = 8^3? Actually 8^3 = 512, no. Let's try: 16^3=4096, 12^3=1728, so not an integer. Let's check: maybe 2048 is not a perfect cube. Alternatively, we can simplify: V^3 = 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). That is the exact answer. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: 2^(2/3) approximately equals 1.5874, so V approx equals 8*1.5874= 12.6992 mph. But the answer is probably expected as cube root of 2048 or as 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). There's no simpler rational number. Alternatively, we can also write it as 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, we have: 32 = (1/64) V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify: 2048/512=4, but not sure.\n\nLet's check: 2^11=2048, cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3).

This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use k to find the unknown wind velocity when P = 32 pounds and A = 4 ft\u00b2:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThis is the exact value of the wind velocity. If you prefer a decimal approximation:\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, so\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given that pressure P varies jointly as area A and cube of wind's velocity V. That means: P = k A V^3. We are given: when V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4 lb. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). But 8^3 = 512. So equation: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So use equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Solve: 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Now we need cube root of 2048. Let's factor: 2048 = 2^11. Wait: 2^11 = 2048. Then cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is not a nice number. Let's check: Possibly we made error. Let's check: Actually, 32 = 1/64 * V^3 implies V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. But maybe we need to find V in miles per hour? But it's not a perfect cube. Let's check: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so V is between 12 and 13 mph. But perhaps the answer is expressed in radical form: V = cube root of 2048 = 8 * cube root of 2^(2/3)? Let me re-check: Actually, 2048 = 2^11. Then cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But that's not a nice number. Alternatively, we can express answer as: V = cube root of (32*64) = cube root of 2048 = 16 * cube root of 8? Wait, let me check: 2048/64 = 32, not sure.\n\nLet's check: 32 = (1/64)*V^3 implies V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. The cube root of 2048 is not a nice integer. But maybe I made a mistake: The problem says \"jointly as the area and the cube of the wind's velocity.\" That means P = k * A * V^3. Our computed constant k = 1/256. Then if A=4, P=32, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, which simplifies to 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, then V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. 2048 is 2^11. So V = 2^(11/3) mph = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3) mph. But perhaps they want a decimal approximation? 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4? Actually, 2^(2/3) = (2^(1/3))^2, and 2^(1/3) is about 1.2599, so squared is about 1.5874. Then V is about 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approximately. But let me re-check: Actually, 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph. So answer: V \u2248 12.70 mph. But wait, maybe we check: if V=12.70 mph, then V^3 = 12.70^3 = 12.70*12.70*12.70, which is about 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 12.7*12.7=161.29, times 12.7 = 2048.383, which is close.\n\nI want to re-check the constant: P = k * A * V^3. With given: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = 1024k, so k=4/1024 = 1/256. So then for second scenario: P=32, A=4, so 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). That is the exact answer.\n\nMaybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That is the exact answer. Alternatively, approximate to 12.70 mph.\n\nLet's check: Actually, 8 * cube root of 4 mph = 8* (cube root of 4) mph. Cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph. So answer: approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any possibility that I misinterpreted \"varies jointly\" as \"P = k A V^3\". Yes, that's correct.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a boxed answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. But wait, let me check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph is the same as 2^(3+2/3)=2^(11/3) mph. But it's best to express as 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as cube root of 2048 mph. But 8* cube root of 4 mph is simpler.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. Alternatively, \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer. I'll produce step-by-step explanation and final answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph. We'll include mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer with reasoning.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

So solve for k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nThen we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So plug in: 32 = k * 4 * V^3, where k = 1/256. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's simplify: 2048 = 2^? 2048 = 2^11. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But then we can also compute approximate value: cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. But maybe we can express answer as 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, simplify: 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, maybe we can express as 8 * cube root of 4. Wait, let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3)=2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But likely the answer is expressed as \"cube root of 2048\" mph, or \"8 * cube root of 4 mph.\" Alternatively, we can simplify further: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). Let me check if it's a neat number: Actually, 2^(11/3) is not a nice integer because 2^3=8, 2^(4)=16, so it's in between 8 and 16. Let's compute: cube root of 2048 approximates: 12.7 mph.

Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply (1/256) by 4:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 because 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048. Therefore:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express this as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(9/3) \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}\n\nThis is the exact answer; if you approximate it, you get approximately 12.7 mph.",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have P = k A V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 square feet, P=4 pounds. So find k: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find wind velocity when A=4, P=32. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3. 32 * 64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^? Let's check: 2^11=2048, since 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V = cube root (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8 * cube root(4). But maybe the answer expects numerical value? Let's see: cube root of 2048 =? Wait, check: 2^(11/3) is not an integer. But maybe we can simplify: Actually 2048=8*256, so cube root of 2048 = cube root(8*256)= cube root(8)* cube root(256)= 2* cube root(256)= 2* cube root(256). But cube root of 256 is not integer either. Alternatively, we can say V = 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we want a decimal approximation: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666) approx? Let's compute: 2^3.6666 = e^(3.6666 ln2) = e^(3.6666*0.6931) = e^(2.541)= approx 12.70 mph. Let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66667)= about 12.7 mph. But wait, let's recalc: 2^3=8, 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4 = about 1.5874, product is 8*1.5874=12.699. So answer: V approx 12.7 mph. But maybe the answer expects answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is equivalent to 8*2^(2/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nHowever, the problem likely expects a symbolic answer: V=8* cube root(2)? Wait, let's re-check: 2048 = 2^11, cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V=8*2^(2/3). But check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, so answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4). But we can also simplify: 8*(cube root of 4) mph. But 8*(cube root of 4) mph is not simpler than 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can leave answer as cube root of 2048 mph.\n\nLet's check: 8*(cube root of 4) mph. But wait, 8*(cube root of 4) is exactly 8*(cube root of 4) mph. But maybe we want a decimal approximation.\n\nLet's check: 8*(cube root of 4) = 8*1.5874=12.6992 mph. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. I'll produce final answer with step-by-step explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{12.7} mph approx.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph}}.

This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nCalculate 8\u00b3:\n\u2003\u20038\u00b3 = 512\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant part:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\nCalculate 32 \u00d7 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nThus:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nSo:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nStep 4. Approximate the value:\n\u2003\u2003\u221b4 \u2248 1.5874\n\nThus:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.6992 mph\n\nRounded to a reasonable degree of accuracy, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{12.7 \\text{ mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So mathematically: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4, so we have 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so equation becomes 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then find wind velocity when pressure on sail area 4 is 32 pounds. So 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root equals 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8* cube root of 4, but maybe a simpler expression: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But we can also compute approximate value: cube root of 2048 is cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = cube root of 8 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of 256 = 2 * (cube root of 256). But 256 = 2^8, so cube root equals 2^(8/3) = 2^(2+2/3) = 4 * cube root of 4, so not simpler. Alternatively, note that 2048 = 8^3? Wait, check: 8^3 = 512, not 2048. Let's recalc: 8^3 = 512, 16^3 = 4096, so no. So answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph. But cube root of 2048 equals 12.7 approx? Let's recalc: cube root of 2048 = e^(ln(2048)/3) = e^(7.625/3) = e^(2.54167) = 12.70 approx mph.\n\nWait, let me recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). 2^(2/3) is approx 1.5874, so product is 8*1.5874 = 12.699. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nBut wait, check: earlier, 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so k = 4/(1024) = 1/256, then second equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, or approx 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, check: Actually, 2^(11/3) mph is the exact expression.\n\nWe can also simplify: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, express as 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Because 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, and 2^(2/3) is cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4 mph. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll provide answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when:\n\u2003\u2003P = 32 pounds and A = 4 ft\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: When V = 8 mph, A = 2 square feet, P = 4 pounds. So substitute: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when P = 32 pounds and A = 4 square feet. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. So solve: V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's see: 2048 = 2^11. Cube root: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) which is not a nice integer. But let's check: maybe it's 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8*(cube root of 4). So answer: wind velocity = 8*(cube root of 4) mph. Alternatively, if we want to approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so product is 8*1.5874 = 12.699, about 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me check: 8 mph gives pressure 4 lbs with 2 sq ft. Then 4 sq ft and 12.7 mph gives pressure: k * 4*(12.7^3) = (1/256)*4*(12.7^3) approximates? 12.7^3 = 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 2048. So indeed 32 lbs. So answer: wind velocity = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, we can write: wind velocity = 8*(cube root of 4) mph.\n\nWait, check: 4*(cube root of 4) = 4 * 1.5874 = 6.3496, but then multiplied by 8? Wait, let's recalc: Actually, 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * (cube root of 4) mph. So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWe can also simplify: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.587, so answer is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a boxed format.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ miles per hour}}.\n\nI'll produce answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lbs, substitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lbs.\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nNow, solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Take the cube root of both sides to solve for V:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048). Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nRecognize that 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) = \u221b(2\u00b2) = \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 mph\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}",

So plug: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = 1024k. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11, since 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So cube root: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can say V = cube root(2048) = 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe the answer is expressed as cube root of 2048, which simplifies to 8 * cube root of 4? Wait, check: cube root of 2048 = cube root (2^11) = 2^(11/3). We can write 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But is that simpler? Alternatively, we can write 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut is that the intended answer? Let me check: The problem statement: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So we got V^3 = 2048, V = cube root of 2048, which is 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But let me see if there's a simpler expression: maybe it's better to simplify as: 32 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 mph = 2^(11/3) mph. That's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if we want a decimal approximation: 2^(11/3) approximates to 2^(3.6667) ~ 2^3.6667 = 2^3 * 2^(0.6667) = 8 * 1.6 = 12.8 mph approx. Actually, 2^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, so 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. So answer: about 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me recalc: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4 = approx 1.5874, times 8 equals approx 12.699 mph.\n\nHowever, I want to check: 8 mph was given for 2 square feet, 4 psi. For 4 square feet, 32 psi, the velocity must be higher. We got 12.7 mph, which is not a nice integer. But let's check the joint variation: P = k A V^3, k = 1/256. For A=4, V=12.7 mph, then V^3 = about 12.7^3 = 2048, times (4/256) = 32, yes.\n\nWait, but then the cube of 12.7 mph is about 2048 exactly? Let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 approximates to 12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7 = 2048.383, which is about 2048. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but I want to check if maybe we can express the answer in radical form: V = \u221b(2048) = \u221b(2^11) = 2^(11/3). That is the simplest exact answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify as: V = 8\u221b4 mph. But that's not simpler than 2^(11/3). Alternatively, we can express as: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWe can also express as: V = 4\u221b(16) mph, but that is not simpler.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is acceptable.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also express as: V = cube root of 2048 mph.\n\nI can check: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3).\n\nThus answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, approx 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in the required format: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer in a final answer box.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3,\n\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3.\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = 1024k.\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256.\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048.\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2048).\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9,\nso\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3).\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) mph\u2003\u2003\u2003or\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nFor a numerical approximation, note that 2^(2/3) is approximately 1.5874, so\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph.\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is approximately 12.7 miles per hour.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ mph}}.",

Wait let me recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = maybe 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8* cube root of 4? Actually, 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait: 2^(2/3) is not cube root of 4? Let's check: cube root of 4 = 4^(1/3). But 2^(2/3) = (2^2)^(1/3)= 4^(1/3) indeed. So answer: V = 8 * 4^(1/3) mph. Alternatively, we can leave answer in radical form.\n\nAlternatively, we can check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph is the answer. But maybe we can simplify further: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Let's check: 8* cube root of 4 = 8* (approx 1.5874) = 12.699 mph. So answer is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce answer. However, wait: The problem states \"When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds.\" But then \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Wait, check: P = k A V^3. k = 1/256. Then for A=4 and P=32, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. So V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). That is the answer.\n\nI'll now produce answer.\n\nI'll produce answer in final answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer in final answer.

So we can compute constant: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nThen find wind velocity when pressure P = 32, A = 4. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32 * 64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But perhaps we want a simpler answer? Alternatively, 2^(11/3) is not integer. But let me check: maybe I made error? Let me check: 4/256 = 1/64, then equation: 32 = (1/64)*V^3 => V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, cube root of 2048 =? 12.7 approx? Actually, 12.7^3 is approx 2048. But wait, maybe it's simpler: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root equals 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6667) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6667) = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is the exact expression. But maybe we can simplify further? 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, so answer is 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, but the problem might be expecting a numerical answer? Let me check: 2^(11/3) = cube root of (2^11) = cube root of (2048) = cube root of (2048) is not a nice integer. But perhaps I can see if the problem intended a nice answer. Let me re-read: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That is unusual: normally pressure is proportional to V^2, not V^3. But anyway. \"When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds.\" That gives constant. \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" That gives equation: 32 = k * 4 * V^3. And k = 1/256. Then 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). That is the answer. But maybe we can express 2^(2/3) as cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so V is about 8*1.5874 = 12.699, about 12.7 mph. But the problem might be expecting an exact answer. Possibly the answer is 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nLet me check: The constant is computed: k = P/(A*V^3) = 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256, then for second scenario: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). That's the answer.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's check: 2^(11/3) is not 12.7 mph exactly? Let's compute: cube root of 2048 = e^( (ln 2048)/3 ) = e^( (ln(2^11))/3 ) = e^( (11 ln2)/3 ) = 2^(11/3). 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, which is approximately 1.5874, so product is 12.699 mph, which is plausible.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can simplify further: 8 * cube root of 4 = 8 * (4^(1/3)). But that's not simpler.\n\nAlternatively, we can express as V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}} or \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll provide the answer in the required format: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll also provide approximate value: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a final answer box.\n\nI'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are given a new situation where A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\nWe need the cube root of 2048. Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u00b2\u00b9\u00b9\u221a(2048) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{miles per hour}}\n\nFor an approximate value, note that \u221b4 \u2248 1.587, so:\n\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.587 \u2248 12.7 mph.",

When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So the relationship is: P = k A V^3. Given: when V = 8, A=2, P=4, so we get: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. Now next: find V when A=4, P=32. So 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. We can simplify: 2048=2^? Let's factor: 2048=2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want a decimal approximation: cube root of 4 approx= 1.5874, so V approx= 8*1.5874=12.6992 mph approx. But maybe it's best to leave answer in exact form: V= 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 4 is not a rational number. Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, check: Actually, 2^(11/3) mph. Alternatively, if we want to simplify: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we can leave answer as: V = 2^(11/3) mph. Wait, let me check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want an approximate value: approximately 12.7 mph. But question: \"Find the wind velocity\" likely expects an exact answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph or 8 cube root of 4 mph. But let me check: maybe they intended to get a nice number. Let's check: 8 mph yields pressure 4 pounds. For a sail of 4 square feet and 32 pounds, the ratio: P increased by factor 32/4=8, but area increased by factor 2, so the velocity factor must be cube root of (8/2) = cube root of 4. So velocity increases by factor cube root of 4, so 8*(cube root of 4) mph. That is the answer.\n\nWait, let me check: We have P1=4 = k * 2 * (8^3). Then k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for second case, P2=32= (1/256)*4* V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048= cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3). That is the answer.\n\nThus answer: V=2^(11/3) mph, or 8 cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.

Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the right side:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\u2003\u2003So, 32 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = 2048, hence:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 2048\n\nStep 3.

            "solution": "We are given a problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant of proportionality. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4, then 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512. So equation: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. Then k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow given: P=32, A=4, find V. So 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, and V = cube root of 2048. Let's simplify: 2048 = 2^11 (because 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048). So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). That can be written as 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. But maybe we want a decimal approx. Alternatively, note that 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = approximate value: 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * cube root of 2^2. Actually wait, let me recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, which is approximately 1.5874, so product is 8*1.5874 = 12.699, approx 12.7 mph. But let's check: 8* (cube root of 4) is exactly answer. Alternatively, we can also write as (cube root of 2048) mph. However, maybe we want answer in simplified radical form: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find a nicer simplification: 2^(11/3) is not a nice integer. So answer: The wind velocity is 8*\u221b4 mph. But wait, let's check: 8 mph gives pressure 4 pounds on 2 square feet. For 4 square feet and 32 pounds, the ratio: 32/4 = 8 times pressure, but area doubled from 2 to 4, so doubling area doubles pressure, so remaining factor 4 is due to velocity cubed factor. So velocity factor must be cube root of 4, so velocity is 8 times cube root of 4. But wait, check: Actually, we can solve: 32 = k * 4 * V^3, and k = 1/256, so then V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8^3 * something)? Wait, 8^3 =512, so not exactly.\n\nLet's check: 2048/512 = 4, so 2048 = 512*4, so cube root of 2048 = cube root of (512*4) = cube root of 512 * cube root of 4 = 8 * cube root of 4, exactly.\n\nSo answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want a decimal approximation: V \u2248 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699 mph, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI want to check: 8 mph with 2 sq ft gives pressure: k=1/256, so pressure= (1/256)*2*8^3= (1/256)*2*512= (1/256)*1024=4. Good.\n\nNow for 4 sq ft: (1/256)*4*V^3=32, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048 = 8 * cube root of 4, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer with explanation. I'll produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce answer.

            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. So we have P = k * A * V^3. When V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So plug in: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So the relation is P = (1/256)*A*V^3. Now find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32 * 64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Now take cube root: cube root of 2048 equals? Let's factor: 2048 = 2^? Actually 2^11 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we might want to simplify further. Alternatively, we can write as V = 8 * cube root of 4. But is that simplified? Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, so V approx 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph, approx 12.7 mph. But maybe the answer is best left as cube root of 2048. Alternatively, we can simplify as 8* cube root of 4 mph. But wait, let me check: 2^(11/3) equals 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. But maybe they want an exact expression. But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) is the same as cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can say V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) = (2^3) * (2^(2/3)) = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But is that the simplest? Alternatively, we can simplify 2048 = 2^11. The cube root is 2^(11/3). So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = (2^(2/3)) * 2^3 = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is acceptable.\n\nHowever, note: It is possible to simplify further if we express as 8* cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as V = 8 * (cube root of 4) mph.\n\nWait, but maybe we can simplify: The cube root of 4 is not a rational number. So the answer remains in radical form.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify 2^(11/3) mph. But I want to check if it's intended to be an exact answer. Let me re-read the problem: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = approx 12.7 mph.

That is acceptable.\n\nWait, but I can check: 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, if we want an approximate value, it's about 12.7 mph. But I'll leave answer in exact form.\n\nI'll also check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, and cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{2^{\\frac{11}{3}} \\text{ miles per hour}} or \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ miles per hour}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.

            "solution": "We are given: Pressure P is jointly varying with area A and cube of velocity V. So we have P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given: when velocity is 8 mph and area is 2, pressure is 4. So 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. Now second scenario: Pressure is 32 pounds, area is 4 square feet, unknown velocity V. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. That equals (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. So then equation: 32 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Factor: 2048 = 2^11? Actually, 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Alternatively, we can simplify: V = cube root(2048). But maybe we want a decimal approximation: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * cube root(4) = 8 * approx 1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approximately. But let me check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4 approx 1.5874, so answer is 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx. But maybe the answer expects exact value: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can also write it as 2^(11/3) mph. But perhaps a simpler representation: The cube root of 2048 is 12.7 mph approx.\n\nLet's double-check: if velocity is 12.7 mph, then pressure becomes 1/256 * 4 * (12.7^3). But 12.7^3 is about 2048, so that yields 4 * 2048/256 = 4 * 8 = 32. So it's correct.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nWait, I'm re-checking: Actually, 12.7 mph is approximate. But wait, 12.7 mph is the velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Let me check: For V=12.7 mph, then V^3 is 12.7^3 = 2048 approx. Then pressure = (1/256)*4*(2048)= (4*2048)/256 = 8192/256 = 32. So it's correct.\n\nBut let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3) mph. So answer: wind velocity = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.6666)= 12.7 mph approx.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also write: V = cube root of (32 * 64) mph = cube root of 2048 mph, which is exactly that.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph} \\approx 12.7 \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer accordingly.

This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003Substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when P = 32 pounds and A = 4 ft\u00b2:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b(4) mph\n\nFor a numerical approximation:\n\u2003\u20032^(2/3) \u2248 1.5874, so\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nTherefore, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph} \\quad (\\text{approximately } 12.7 \\text{ mph})}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. When V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So then find k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now find V when A=4, P=32: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, so 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. Now find V = cube root of 2048. But 2048= 2^11? Let's check: 2^11=2048. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4. Alternatively, we can simplify further: 2^(11/3)=? Wait, maybe we can simplify: 2048 = 8^3? Actually, check: 8^3=512, so not. Let's see: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096. So not exactly. So answer: V = cube root of 2048. Alternatively, we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3)= 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can simplify further: cube root of 4 is not rational. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 8 * 1.5874= 12.699 mph approx. But let's see: 2^(2/3)= (2^(1/3))^2. The cube root of 2 is approx 1.26, squared equals 1.587. So answer: approx 12.7 mph.\n\nWait check: (8 mph? Actually, we want V when A=4, P=32. Let's check: if V=12.7 mph, then V^3= approx 12.7^3= 2048, exactly, so that's consistent.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWe can also express as: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer in text.

This relationship can be written as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the value of k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant factors:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4 mph\n\nIf you prefer a decimal approximation, note that \u221b4 is approximately 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.7 mph\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}",

Given: when velocity = 8 mph, area = 2 ft^2, pressure = 4 lb, then we have 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. Solve: k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So 32 = k * 4 * V^3. Using k = 1/256, so 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply: (1/256)*4 = 4/256 = 1/64. So equation: 32 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048: 2048 = 2^11. Cube root: cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But we want a simpler answer? Possibly as cube root of 2048. Alternatively, we can compute approximate: cube root of 2048 approximates to? Actually, 8^3 = 512, 16^3 = 4096. So it's between 8 and 16, but more precisely: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 12.7 approx. Wait, let's recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * (cube root of 4) ~ 8 * 1.5874 = 12.6992. But perhaps the problem expects answer as cube root of 2048 mph? But we can simplify: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe we want answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as 8 * (2^(2/3)). But I'm not sure if the problem expects an exact answer or a decimal approximation. The problem is from a joint variation problem. It might be acceptable to leave answer as cube root of 2048 mph. But let me check: The problem states \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph, which simplifies to 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can write: V = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: about 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, check: 8* cube root of 4 = 8*(4^(1/3)) = 8*(1.5874) = 12.699. But wait, the problem is from a joint variation problem and likely expects answer as: V = cube root of 2048 mph, which simplifies to 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But is that acceptable? Let me check: P = k A V^3, k = 1/256, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, then V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) mph. So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph. Let me check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.66666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.66666) = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph. Yes.\n\nWe can also express as: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That's the simplest exact form.\n\nI'll answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box. I'll produce final answer as: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph} \\text{ (approximately 12.70 mph)}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer accordingly.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb:\n\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003\u20038\u00b3 = 512, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003We are told that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply (1/256) by 4:\n\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nWe have given: P \u221d A * V^3. So P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant.\n\nGiven: when V=8, A=2, P=4. So 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow we want: when A=4, P=32, find V such that: 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. So multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor: 2048 = 2^11. So cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. But maybe simpler: V = 2^(11/3) mph. But likely we want numeric approximate value? 2^(11/3) = exp((11/3)*ln2) = exp( (11/3)*0.6931) = exp(2.540) = 12.7 approx. But let's check: 12.7^3 ~ 2048? Let's compute approximate: 12.7^3 = 12.7 * 12.7 * 12.7 = (161.29) * 12.7 = 2048.383? Yes approximate.\n\nBut maybe we want exact form: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But is that the simplest form? Possibly answer: The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, let's check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can express as: V = 2^(11/3). Let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx.\n\nThus answer: The wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or about 12.7 mph. But wait, check: 2^11 = 2048, cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, but let me check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nBut the problem might be solved in steps: Let k be constant, then solve for k, then solve for V. So answer: V = cube root of (32*256/4)? Let's check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). So answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer with steps.

Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 sq ft, P=4 pounds, so we have 4 = k * 2 * 8^3 = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when A=4 sq ft, P=32 pounds. Use formula: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3, i.e. 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, so cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, if we need a decimal approximate: cube root of 4 is approx 1.5874, so V approx 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699, or 12.70 mph. But check: Actually, 8^3=512, so with k=1/256, then P= (1/256)*4*(V^3) = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. So 32= V^3/64, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048. Let's simplify: 2048= 2^11, cube root is 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer is 8*2^(2/3) mph.

When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\"\n\nLet's denote that P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant of proportionality. Given: When V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4 lbs, then 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4= k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then next: when A=4, P=32, then 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11, because 2^11=2048. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But we might want a numerical answer: 2^(2/3) is approx 1.5874, so V approx 8*1.5874 = 12.699, but probably answer as cube root of 2048, or 8* cube root of 4? Wait, let's check: Actually, 2^(11/3) = (2^(1/3))^11? Wait, let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 +2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But we can also express that as 8*(cube root of 4) because 2^(2/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity = 8 cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nWait, let's check: 8^3=512, then P= (1/256)*2*512= (1/256)*1024=4, correct.\n\nSo answer: V = 8*(cube root of 4) mph.\n\nWe can also check: Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 8^3? Actually 8^3=512, not 2048. Let's check: 12.7^3 = 12.7*12.7*12.7, approximate: 12.7^3 = 2048. So answer: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nBetter: V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph.\n\nBut I can also note: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with explanation.

            "solution": "We are given a physics problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. We are given: when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So compute constant k = P/(A*V^3) = 4/(2*(8^3)). But 8^3=512. So k = 4/(2*512) = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then the formula becomes P = (A * V^3)/256. Next, we are given: for A=4, P=32, find V. So equation: 32 = (4 * V^3)/256. Multiply both sides: 32*256 = 4 * V^3, so V^3 = (32*256)/4 = (8192)/4 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now compute cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. So V^3 = 2^11. So V = cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But perhaps we want the answer in simplest radical form? Alternatively, we can write cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256)= 2* cube root of 256? Let's try: 2048= 8*256, so cube root of 2048 = cube root of 8 * cube root of 256 = 2 * cube root of 256. But cube root of 256= cube root of (2^8)= 2^(8/3)= 2^(2+2/3)= 4*2^(2/3). So that gives V=2*4*2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But that is not simpler. Alternatively, we can express as 2^(11/3). But maybe we want a decimal approximation. Let's compute cube root of 2048. Cube root of 2048= approximate value: cube root of 2048= approximate: cube root of 2048= 12.7? Wait, let's compute: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so cube root is between 12 and 13, but more precisely: 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7= 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3= 12.7*12.7=161.29, multiplied by 12.7 gives 2048.383, so it's approximately 12.7 mph. But wait, check: Actually, 12.7 mph is approximate. But we can check: 12.7^3= 2048.383, which is close to 2048. But we want exact value maybe in simplest radical form: V=2^(11/3). Alternatively, we can simplify: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3). That is acceptable answer. But maybe we want a decimal approximation: about 12.7 mph. But the question says \"Find the wind velocity\", so answer: 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph. But let me re-check: P = k*A*V^3, given P=4 when A=2 and V=8, so k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for A=4 and P=32, equation: 32= (4*V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256: 32*256= 4V^3, so V^3= (32*256)/4= (32/4)*256=8*256=2048. So V= cube root of 2048= cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, so V=8* cube root of 4 mph. That is the same as 8* cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also express as: 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to simplify: cube root of 4 is not simpler than that.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.

            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as area A and cube of wind velocity V. That is, P = k A V^3 for some constant k. Then using the given data: when velocity is 8 mph, pressure on sail of area 2 sq ft is 4 pounds. So we get 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k * 2 * 512 = 1024 k. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. Then we want to find velocity V when pressure on sail of area 4 sq ft is 32 pounds. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, i.e., V^3 = 2048. Then compute cube root of 2048. 2^11 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can write it as 8 * cube root of 4, but maybe we want a decimal approximation. But maybe we want to simplify. Let's check: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3). We can also write it as 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can compute cube root of 2048 exactly: 12.7 mph approximately? Let's check: 12^3 = 1728, 13^3 = 2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But maybe the answer is expressed in radical form.\n\nWait, 2048 = 8 * 256, so cube root of 2048 = cube root of (8*256) = 2 * cube root of 256. But cube root of 256 = cube root of 2^8 = 2^(8/3) = 2^(2+2/3) = 4 * cube root of 4. That doesn't simplify nicely. Let's see: Alternatively, 2^(11/3) is the simplest answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can note: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity = 8 cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we can rationalize: Let cube root of 4 be left as is.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = 12.7 mph approx. But I'd like to give an exact answer in radical form: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, let me check: k = 1/256. Then equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, yes.\n\nWe can simplify further: 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) mph. But we can also write it as 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Possibly the answer: wind velocity is 8*2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^(2/3) is cube root of 4, so 8 * cube root of 4 mph. That's the answer.\n\nThus final answer: wind velocity is 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with reasoning.\n\nI'll produce answer with step-by-step reasoning.\n\nI'll produce answer with final answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer in \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce answer with answer in a box.\n\nI'll produce answer with final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given data:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = 1024k\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003We are given A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given that pressure P is jointly proportional to the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. So we can express: P = k A V^3. Given when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4 pounds. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k= 4/1024 = 1/256. Then next we are asked: when A=4 square feet and P=32 pounds, find V. So we have: 32 = (1/256)*4 * V^3. Then compute: (1/256)*4 = 4/256=1/64. So equation: 32 = (1/64) V^3, multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So then V = cube root of 2048. Now compute cube root: 2048 = 2^11? Let's check: 2^11=2048, so V^3=2^11, then V=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V=8 cube root of 4 mph, but maybe we can compute approximate value: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so then V=8*1.5874=12.699, about 12.70 mph. But maybe the answer in exact form: 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, maybe we can simplify: Actually, wait check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer is: V=8 * 2^(2/3) mph. That is the answer. Let me check: if V=8*2^(2/3), then cube of that is (8^3)*(2^(2))=512*4=2048, and then times constant: (1/256)*4= 4/256=1/64, then product is 2048/64=32, which works.\n\nBut wait, let's check: 8^3=512, then 2*512=1024, so k=4/1024=1/256. Then for second case: P= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3= (32*256)/4= (8192)/4=2048, so yes.\n\nSo answer: V=8*2^(2/3) mph, which is exactly 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait, can we simplify further? 2^(2/3) is not a rational number. Alternatively, we can say V= 8\u221b4 mph. That is the exact answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can express as V=12.7 mph approx.\n\nThus final answer: V=8\u221b4 mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI can also check if the answer is supposed to be exactly expressed as cube root of 2048, which is 12.7 mph. But the given constants: P varies jointly as A and V^3. So I'm going to check: P= k A V^3, so k= P/(A V^3)= 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for second: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so V= cube root of 2048. But cube root of 2048= cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8\u221b4. So answer.\n\nThus I'll answer: The wind velocity is 8\u221b4 mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. I'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce answer in final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nStep 1. Find the constant of proportionality k using the given information:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003So, 4 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024.\n\u2003\u2003Thus, k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Simplify (1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64:\n\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3.\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048.\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048.\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3).\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we can also write:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nThus, the wind velocity is exactly 8\u221b4 miles per hour, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So the equation: P = k * A * V^3. Given data: when A=2, V=8, P=4. So substitute: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. Compute 8^3 = 512. So then 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So k=1/256.\n\nNow we want: when A=4, P=32, find V. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply out: 4/256=1/64. So equation: 32 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Now compute cube root of 2048. Factorize 2048: 2048=2^11? Actually 2^11=2048 exactly. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3). But that's not an integer. But maybe we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3)? But not a nice number. Wait, let's check: The problem might be expecting a rational number. Let's re-read problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" Possibly we might have misread \"cube\" as \"square\"? But it says \"cube of the wind's velocity\" which is V^3. Let's check: With given numbers: P = k * A * V^3. For A=2, V=8, then P= k * 2 * 512 = 1024k. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for A=4, P=32, equation becomes: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, so V = cube root of 2048. But cube root of 2048 is not a whole number. Let's compute approximate: cube root of 2048 = 12.7? Let's check: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But maybe the answer is expressed in radical form: V = 2^(11/3). But we can simplify further: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3)=2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, can we express 2^(2/3) as cube root of 4? So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 miles per hour. But let me check: 8 * cube root of 4. Alternatively, can we express as cube root of 2048, but that is not simplified. Let's check: 8 * cube root of 4 is the same as cube root of (8^3 * 4) = cube root of (512*4)= cube root of 2048. So answer is V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait, maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 4 doesn't simplify to a rational number. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But let me check if the problem expects a numerical answer. Possibly the answer: \"8\u221b4 mph\" is acceptable. Let me check if we misinterpreted the \"cube\" as \"square\"? But it's given \"cube of the wind's velocity\" which is V^3. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pressure is directly proportional to V^2? But the problem explicitly says \"cube\" so it's V^3.\n\nLet me check: When V=8 mph, pressure=4 lbs on a 2 square foot sail. So k=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for A=4, P=32, equation: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3=32*64=2048. So V= cube root of 2048. Factor 2048=2^11, so cube root equals 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8 cube root of (2^2)=8 cube root of 4 mph. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWe can approximate: cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874, so 8*1.5874=12.6992 mph approximately. So answer: about 12.7 mph.\n\nWait, let me check if the problem might be expecting an answer in exact form: \"8 cube root of 4 mph\" or \"2^(11/3) mph\" or \"cube root of 2048 mph.\" Possibly \"8\u221b4 mph\" is acceptable.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in boxed format. I'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}. However, I must check instructions: \"Please reason step by step and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" So I'll produce final answer in a final boxed answer.\n\nI'll produce step-by-step explanation. We'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer with explanation. We'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll produce final answer.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given data:\n\u2003\u2003When A = 2 ft\u00b2, V = 8 mph, and P = 4 lbs, substitute these values into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = 1024k\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lbs.\n\u2003\u2003Substitute A = 4, P = 32, and k = 1/256 into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant factor:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus,\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2\u00b2 (which is 4), we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nSo, the wind velocity is:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4 mph\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" This means P = k * A * V^3. We are given that when V = 8 mph, A = 2, P = 4. So we find constant k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow find wind velocity when P = 32, A = 4. So equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64) * V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Let's factor 2048 = 2^? 2^11 = 2048, because 2^11=2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But then that's not a nice integer. Let me recalc: Wait, check: 32*64 = 2048, and cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want to simplify further: 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we can simplify: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But is that the intended answer? Let's check: 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 4 approx 1.5874, so V approx 12.699 mph. But maybe they want an exact expression.\n\nWait, let me check: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 => 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. Now factor 2048 = 2^11. So V = 2^(11/3) mph. That is an acceptable answer. But let me check: Alternatively, we can factor 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: 8*2^(2/3) mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can write: V = 8 * cube root(4) mph. But which is the simplest? Possibly \"2^(11/3)\" mph is acceptable.\n\nWait, check: 2^(11/3) mph is the exact expression. But let me check if the problem expects an integer answer: Possibly not.\n\nWait, check: \"The pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So P = k A V^3. When V=8 mph, A=2, P=4, so k = 4/(2*512) = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for A=4 and P=32, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) mph, which is the answer.\n\nNow check: 2^(11/3) mph = 2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). That's the answer. Alternatively, we can approximate: 2^(2/3) approx 1.5874, so V approx 12.699 mph. But maybe the answer expected is in radical form.\n\nI can express the answer as V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nYes, because cube root of 4 is exactly \u221b4. So answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI can also check: 8\u221b4 mph ~ 8*1.5874 = 12.699 mph, which is the approximate answer.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in the required formatting: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a box.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means that\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nfor some constant k.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 lb, substitute into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolving for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 lb:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9 (since 2\u00b9\u00b9 = 2048), so:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nAlternatively, since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\u2003mph",

            "solution": "We are given: The pressure P is proportional to area A and cube of wind velocity V. So P = k * A * V^3. When velocity is 8 mph, pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. So we have: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then we find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. So 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. So 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Now compute cube root: 2048 = 2^11 = 2048. Cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we want an exact answer. Let me check: 8^3=512, 10^3=1000, 11^3=1331, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197. So it's not an integer. Wait, let me re-check: Actually, let me re-check the calculation: 8^3=512, multiplied by 2 gives 1024, then k=4/1024=1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, so equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64=V^3, 32*64=2048, so V^3=2048. Cube root of 2048 =? Let's factor: 2048=2^11, cube root of 2^11=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8* cube root of 4. So answer is V = 8* cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want a decimal approximation: cube root of 4 ~ 1.5874, so V ~ 8*1.5874=12.699, so approx 12.7 mph. But maybe we want the answer in radical form: V=8\u221b4 mph. But wait, the problem said \"Find the wind velocity\", so answer: 8\u221b4 mph. But maybe they want the exact answer.\n\nWait, but note that the problem states: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" This means P = k A V^3. And then \"When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds.\" So k = 4 / (2*(8^3)) = 4/1024=1/256. Then \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3 = 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048 = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4.

            "solution": "We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. That is P = k A V^3 for some constant k. Given that when V=8 mph, A=2, P=4. So we plug in: 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So the formula becomes: P = (A V^3)/256.\n\nNow we need find wind velocity when P=32, A=4. So we have 32 = (4 * V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4 V^3. 32*256 = 8192? Let's check: 32*256 = 8192. Then 8192 = 4 V^3, so V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048. Then find V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048 = 2^? Let's check: 2^11 = 2048. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) which is not a nice integer. Wait maybe we must have integer result. Let's re-check: Actually, let's recompute: 4 square feet, 32 pounds. Possibly I've made a mistake. Let's check: P = k A V^3, and k = 1/256. Then 32 = (4 V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256 gives 32*256 = 4 V^3, so 8192 = 4 V^3, so V^3 = 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11. So cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So that's not an integer. Let me check the problem statement: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" Possibly the answer is 16 mph? Let's check: If V=16 mph, then V^3 = 4096, times area 4 gives 4*4096=16384, divided by 256 equals 64, not 32. So not that.\n\nWait maybe re-read the problem: \"varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V\" means P = k * A * V^3. And we have given: when V=8, A=2, P=4, then constant k = 4/(2*512)= 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for P=32, A=4, we have 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4V^3)/256 = V^3/64. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. So V = cube root of 2048. Cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). That is not a nice number. But maybe they want an answer in radical form: 8\u221b(4)? Because 2^(2/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)= 4^(1/3). So answer = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. But is that the simplest answer? Alternatively, we can write as 2^(11/3) mph. Let me check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). So answer: 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nWait, but let's check: 2^(11/3) is approximately 2^(3.6667)= 2^3.6667= about 12.7 mph. Let's compute: 2^(11/3) = exp((11/3)*ln2)= exp(3.6667*0.6931)= exp(2.543)= 12.7 mph approx. That seems plausible.\n\nBut maybe we can simplify the constant k differently. Alternatively, maybe I've misinterpreted the phrase \"varies jointly as A and the cube of V\". That means P \u221d A V^3. So constant k is determined by P = k A V^3. Given P=4, A=2, V=8, then k = 4/(2*(8^3)) = 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. So it's correct.\n\nWait, maybe we need to check if the problem is intended to have an integer answer. Perhaps I'm reading the numbers wrong. Let's re-read: \"When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds.\" That gives k = 4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256, as computed.\n\nNow for the second scenario: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So then equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4V^3)/256 = V^3/64. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). That is the answer. We can also express as 8\u221b(4) mph. Let me check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2= cube root of 4. So answer: 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nI can also approximate: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, so 8*1.5874= 12.699, about 12.7 mph. But the problem might be expecting an exact answer in radical form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express it as cube root of 2048 mph, but that's not simplified. So final answer: 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nLet me check if there's any possibility that the problem intended to use the formula P = k A V^3, but maybe \"varies jointly\" means P = k A V^3. That is standard.\n\nWait, let me check if the constant is computed correctly: For V=8, A=2, P=4, then k = 4/(2*512)=4/1024= 1/256. Yes.\n\nNow for second scenario: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so 32 = (4V^3)/256, multiply both sides by 256: 32*256= 4V^3, so V^3= (32*256)/4= (8192)/4=2048, so V = cube root of 2048= cube root of 2^11= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8\u221b(4). So answer: 8\u221b4 mph, which is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus final answer: 8\u221b4 mph. We'll box the answer.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph. We'll produce final answer in box.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.

This means we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4/1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\nWe are given that when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we need to find V. Substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4V\u00b3)/256\n\u2003\u200332 = V\u00b3/64\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus,\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express 2^(11/3) as:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 2\u00b2, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4\n\nSo, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\u2003miles per hour.",

Given: when V=8 mph, A=2, then P=4. So compute constant: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2*512 = k*1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256.\n\nNow second: when A=4 square feet and P=32 pounds, find V such that: 32 = (1/256)* 4* V^3, i.e. 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)* V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Let's compute: 2048 = 2^11? Actually 2^11=2048, so cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). But wait, let me check: Actually 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6666)= 2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But maybe the answer expects simplified form? Alternatively, we can compute approximate value: cube root of 2048 is about: cube root of 2048 = about 12.7 mph? Let's check: 12.7^3=12.7*12.7*12.7 = 2048? Let's check: 12.7^3=12.7^2=161.29, times 12.7=2048.383, so it's almost exactly. But maybe the answer expects: V = cube root (2048) mph = 12.7 mph (approx). But let's see if there is a nice fraction: 2048= 2^11, cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). That's the exact answer. Alternatively, we can simplify: 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, so answer = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, let me check: 2^(2/3)= cube root of (2^2)= cube root of 4, so answer = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can write: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, if we want decimal approx: 8 * 1.5874= 12.699, so approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nWe can check: (8 * cube root of 4)^3 = 512 * 4 = 2048, so that's correct.\n\nI must check: Given: 2*8^3= 2*512=1024, then constant k= 4/1024=1/256, then second: 32= (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3=32*256/4=32*64=2048, so yes.\n\nThus answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph = 8 cube root of 4 mph.

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" That means P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V=8 mph and A=2 ft^2, P=4 pounds. So we find constant k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). But 8^3 = 512. So 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. Now find wind velocity when A=4 square feet and P=32 pounds. So equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Multiply: 4/256 = 1/64. So equation becomes: 32 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. But 2048 = 2^11. So V = cube root of 2048 = 2^(11/3). That is not an integer? Let's see: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). But maybe the answer is simplified as cube root of 2048 or approximate numeric value. Alternatively, check if maybe we mis-copied: Actually, let me recalc: P = k A V^3. Given: P=4, A=2, V=8 mph, so k = 4/(2*512) = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then for second scenario: P=32, A=4, so equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Then V = cube root of 2048. Cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, we can express it as 8* cube root of 4. But maybe we want to express as approximate value: cube root of 4 is about 1.5874, then 8*1.5874 = 12.699, approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nBut let me check: 12.7 mph. But is that the intended answer? Let me check: The problem statement: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: wind velocity is cube root of 2048 mph. But maybe they want the answer as 2^(11/3) mph or simplified as 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can check: 8* cube root of 4 mph ~ 8*1.5874 = 12.699 mph, so approx 12.7 mph. But maybe they want an exact expression. Alternatively, we can simplify: 2048 = 8^3 * (2^(2/3))? Let's check: 8^3 = 512, no that's not correct. Actually, 8^3=512, 12.7^3=2050, but not exactly.\n\nWait, let me recalc: 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). And 2^(2/3)= cube root of 2^2 = cube root of 4. So answer: V=8 cube root of 4 mph. But note: 8 cube root of 4 mph is the exact answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can check: V^3=32*64=2048, so V = 2048^(1/3). But 2048=2^11, so V=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nWait, but that is not a nice number. Let me check the arithmetic: Given: P \u221d A * V^3, so P = k A V^3. For first scenario: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3) = k *2*512 = k*1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Then second scenario: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. And cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). That is the answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)= (4)^(1/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nI can also express it as: V = 8 * (4^(1/3)) mph. But maybe they want a decimal approximation: approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity is approximately 12.7 mph.\n\nI can also check: 12.7^3 approximates to 12.7^3 = 2045. So that's consistent.\n\nI can also express answer exactly as: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in a final message.

This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, P = 4 pounds.\n\u2003\u2003Substitute these into the equation:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8\u00b3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\u2003\u2003Solve for k:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity:\n\u2003\u2003Now, when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Simplify the constant part:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\u2003\u2003So the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u2003Multiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00d7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\u2003\u2003Notice that 2048 can be written as 2\u00b9\u00b9, so:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\u2003\u2003This can also be expressed as:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\u2003\u2003Since 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\text{ miles per hour}}.",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So equation: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4 pounds. So we can solve for k: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 =512. So then 4 = k*2*512 = k *1024. So k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet is 32 pounds. Then equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So 32 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3. 32*64 = 2048. So V^3 = 2048. Now find cube root of 2048. But 2048= 2^11? Let's check: 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048, yes. So cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3+2/3)? Actually 11/3=3.6666. But we want to see if it's a nice number. Wait, check: V^3 = 2048. Cube root of 2048 is not an integer? Let's check: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so it's between 12 and 13. But maybe we can express as 2^(11/3)? But maybe we can simplify: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8* cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. But wait, is that the simplest form? Alternatively, we can write V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nBut maybe the answer expects a numerical value? Let's check: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3.6666)= approximate: 2^(3.6666)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(0.6666)= 8*1.5874= 12.699. But problem likely expects answer in terms of radicals. Let me see: 2048= 2^11. Cube root of 2^11 is 2^(11/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8*\u221b(4). So answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph. But wait, check: is that simplified? Because 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can also express answer as 2^(11/3) mph. But perhaps the problem expects a simplified radical: \"the wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph.\" Let me check if the problem expects a simplified radical or a decimal approximation. The problem is from a typical variation problem in algebra. They might want an answer in terms of radicals. I'll provide: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWait, check: 4 square feet, 32 pounds, etc. Let me re-read the problem: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So the equation is P = k A V^3, and k= 4/(2*(8^3))= 4/(2*512)= 4/1024= 1/256. So then for the new values: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, so V^3= 32*256/4 = 32*64 = 2048, so V= cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11) = 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8\u221b(4). So answer: V= 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWe can check: 8\u221b4 approximates to 8*1.5874= 12.699 mph, which is plausible. So answer: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWe can also express answer as 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.We are given that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V.

Find the constant k using the given values:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds, substitute these into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the new wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u2003Substitute into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (4/256) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3.

Therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nThis can be further simplified by writing 11/3 as 3 + 2/3:\n\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nThus, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}",

So 4 = k * 2 * 8^3. 8^3=512, so 4 = k * 2 *512= k *1024. So k=4/1024=1/256. Then new scenario: P=32, A=4, V unknown. So 32= (1/256)*4*V^3 = (4/256)*V^3 = (1/64)*V^3.

When V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, P=4 lbs. So k = 4/(2*(8^3))=4/(2*512)=4/1024=1/256. Then for A=4, P=32, then equation becomes 32= (1/256)*4*V^3= (4/256)*V^3= (1/64)*V^3, so V^3=32*64=2048, then V= cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)=2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)= 8 * 2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further? 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so answer: V=8 * cube root of 4 mph. But maybe check: 8^3=512, 32^3=32768, no. Let's check: (8 * cube root of 4)^3= 8^3 * (cube root of 4)^3=512*4=2048, yes.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity = 8* cube root of 4 mph. But we can also express as 2^(11/3). Alternatively, we can approximate: cube root of 4 is approx 1.5874, so product is approx 8*1.5874=12.699, so about 12.70 mph. But is that the expected answer? Let me re-read problem: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" It doesn't specify if answer is exact or approximate. Possibly answer: \"Approximately 12.70 mph\" or \"exact answer: 8\u221b4 mph.\"\n\nWait, let me check: 8* cube root of 4 mph. But wait, let me check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3). So answer: wind velocity= 8\u221b(4) mph. That is the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe we can simplify further: cube root of 4 = \u221b4 mph. So answer: V= 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWe can also express answer as 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll now produce final answer. We'll produce answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}. We'll now produce final answer with explanation. We'll produce final answer in text.

We'll produce final answer. We'll produce final answer. We'll produce final answer. We'll produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer. We'll produce final answer in text with final answer in \\boxed{}.We are told that the pressure P varies jointly as the area A and the cube of the wind's velocity V. This means we can write the relationship as\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\n\u2003\u2003When V = 8 mph, A = 2 ft\u00b2, and P = 4 pounds,\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to solve for V\u00b3:\n\u2003\u2003V\u00b3 = 32 \u00b7 64 = 2048\n\nStep 3. Solve for V:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus:\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express this as:\n\u2003\u20032^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4 (because (2^(2/3))\u00b3 = 2\u00b2 = 4), we have:\n\u2003\u2003V = 8 \u00b7 \u221b4\n\nSo, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ \\text{mph}}\n\nIf you wish to approximate this value, note that \u221b4 \u2248 1.5874, so:\n\u2003\u2003V \u2248 8 \u00d7 1.5874 \u2248 12.70 mph.",

            "solution": "We are asked: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V. When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So we have equation: P = k * A * V^3. Given: when A=2, V=8, P=4, then 4 = k*2*(8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k*2*512 = k*1024, then k = 4/1024 = 1/256. So then new scenario: A=4, P=32, find V such that 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, then 32 = (4/256)* V^3 = (1/64)*V^3, so multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, 32*64 = 2048, so V^3 = 2048. Now find cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, cube root is 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8*2^(2/3). Alternatively, check: 8^3=512, 16^3=4096, so not an integer. Possibly the answer is not a whole number. Wait, check: 2^11 = 2048, cube root = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3.6666) = 2^3 * 2^(0.6666) = 8 * 2^(2/3). Alternatively, 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4, so answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph. But perhaps we can simplify: 8 cube root of 4 mph is the answer. But maybe we can check: (8 cube root of 4)^3 = 8^3 * 4 = 512*4=2048. Yes.\n\nBut maybe the answer is expected to be expressed in simplest radical form: 8\u221b4 mph. Alternatively, we can check if the problem intended to yield integer. Let's recalc: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3, then multiply both sides by 256: 32*256 = 4V^3, 32*256 = 8192, then V^3 = 8192/4 = 2048, same result.\n\nAlternatively, we can express 2048 as 2^11, so cube root is 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can approximate: cube root of 4 is approx 1.5874, so V approx 8*1.5874 = 12.6992 mph approx.\n\nAlternatively, we can rationalize: V = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nWe can check: If V=8\u221b4, then V^3 = 8^3 * 4 = 512*4=2048, then pressure = (1/256)*4*2048 = (4*2048)/256 = 8192/256=32, yes.\n\nSo answer: V = 8 cube root of 4 mph. In simplest radical form: 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can also write: V = 4 * cube root of 2 mph? Let's see: 8 cube root of 4 = 8 * (4^(1/3)) = 8 * (2^(2/3)) = 2^(3) *2^(2/3)=2^(11/3) but not simpler. Alternatively, 8 cube root of 4 = 4 * cube root of 2? Check: 4 * cube root of 2 = 4 * 2^(1/3) = 4 * 2^(1/3)= 2^2 *2^(1/3)=2^(7/3), not equal to 2^(11/3). Wait, let me check: 8 cube root of 4= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=2^(11/3) and 4 cube root of 2=2^2 *2^(1/3)=2^(7/3). So they are not equal. So answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nAlternatively, we can express it as 2^(11/3) mph. So final answer: V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nI can also check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 +2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8\u221b(2^2)=8\u221b4 mph.\n\nThus answer: wind velocity = 8\u221b4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.\n\nI'll now produce answer with explanation.

So: 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3=512. So: 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024. So k=4/1024=1/256.\n\nNow we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So use formula: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. Simplify: (1/256)*4 = 4/256 = 1/64. So we have: 32 = (1/64)*V^3. Multiply both sides by 64: V^3 = 32*64 = 2048. Now find cube root: V = cube root of 2048. Factor 2048: 2048= 2^11? Wait, 2^11=2048, yes. So V = cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)= 2^3 * 2^(2/3)=8 * cube root of 4. But we can also simplify: cube root of 2^11=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). But maybe we want a decimal approximate? But maybe the answer is expressed as 2^(11/3). Alternatively, 2^(11/3) equals approx? Let's compute: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4= about 1.5874, so times 8= 12.699, so about 12.7 mph. But the problem likely expects an exact answer in terms of radical form. But the problem statement \"Find the wind velocity\" likely expects an answer in radical form. But the problem is ambiguous: maybe they want the velocity in mph? Let me check: \"When the velocity is 8 mph, the pressure on a sail of 2 square feet is 4 pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So answer: V = cube root of 2048 = 8*2^(2/3) mph. But we can also simplify: 2048= 2^11. So cube root of 2^11= 2^(11/3)= 2^(3+2/3)= 8*2^(2/3). But we can also express as 8\u221b4. That is answer.\n\nWait check: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4, yes.\n\nThus answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph. Alternatively, we can say: V = 8*\u221b4 mph.\n\nI can also simplify further: 8\u221b4 mph. But is that simpler? Alternatively, V = 2^(11/3) mph.\n\nBut let me check: P = k A V^3, with k=1/256, so V^3= 32*64 = 2048, so V= cube root of 2048. Yes.\n\nThus final answer: V = cube root of 2048 mph, or simplified: 8\u221b4 mph. Let me check: 8\u221b4 mph approximately equals 8*1.5874= 12.699 mph.\n\nThus answer: 12.699 mph approx.

This means we can write the relationship as:\n\n\u2003\u2003P = k \u00b7 A \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nStep 1. Find the constant k using the given information:\nWhen V = 8 mph and A = 2 ft\u00b2, the pressure P = 4 pounds. Substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 (8)\u00b3\n\nSince 8\u00b3 = 512, we have:\n\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 2 \u00b7 512\n\u2003\u20034 = k \u00b7 1024\n\nSolve for k:\n\n\u2003\u2003k = 4 / 1024 = 1/256\n\nStep 2. Use the constant k to find the wind velocity when A = 4 ft\u00b2 and P = 32 pounds:\nSubstitute k, A, and P into the equation:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/256) \u00b7 4 \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nSimplify the constant term:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1/256) \u00b7 4 = 4/256 = 1/64\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\u2003\u200332 = (1/64) \u00b7 V\u00b3\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 to isolate V\u00b3:\n\n\u2003\u200332 \u00d7 64 = V\u00b3\n\u2003\u20032048 = V\u00b3\n\nStep 3. Solve for V by taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b2048\n\nNotice that 2048 can be written as a power of 2:\n\u2003\u20032048 = 2\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThus:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = \u221b(2\u00b9\u00b9) = 2^(11/3)\n\nWe can also express this as:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 2\u00b3 \u00b7 2^(2/3) = 8 \u00b7 2^(2/3)\n\nSince 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003V = 8\u221b4\n\nSo, the wind velocity is:\n\n\u2003\u2003\\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}}\u2003miles per hour.",

            "solution": "We are given: \"The pressure P exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area A of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity V.\" So we have equation: P = k * A * V^3, where k is constant. Given that when V=8 mph, A=2 sq ft, and P=4 lbs, so 4 = k * 2 * (8^3). 8^3 = 512, so 4 = k * 2 * 512 = k * 1024, so k = 4/1024 = 1/256. Now we are asked: \"Find the wind velocity when the pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds.\" So we have P=32, A=4, so equation: 32 = (1/256) * 4 * V^3. That equals 4/256 * V^3 = (1/64) * V^3. So equation: 32 = V^3 / 64, so V^3 = 32 * 64 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So answer: 8 * 2^(2/3). But perhaps we can simplify further: 2^(2/3) = cube root of 4. So answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph, or approximate value: cube root of 4 approx 1.5874, then 8 * 1.5874 = 12.699, about 12.70 mph. Wait, check: Actually 8 * cube root of 4 mph approx 12.70 mph. Let's check: If V=12.7 mph, then V^3 approximates 12.7^3 = 2048. So yes.\n\nBut let's check: 12.7 mph is approximate. But maybe we want exact expression: V = 8*2^(2/3). But check: Actually wait: Let me recalc: V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. But 2048 = 2^11, so V = 2^(11/3) mph. But 2^(11/3) is not equal to 8 * 2^(2/3)? Let's check: 2^(11/3) = 2^(9/3 + 2/3) = 2^3 * 2^(2/3) = 8 * 2^(2/3). So yes, that's the same. So answer: V = 8 * 2^(2/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nThus final answer: V = 8 * cube root of 4 mph.\n\nThus final answer: The wind velocity is 2^(11/3) mph, or approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in box: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{8 \\sqrt[3]{4} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{12.70 \\text{ mph (approx)}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \\boxed{2^{11/3} \\text{ mph}}.\n\nI'll produce final answer in final answer message.

            "solution": "We are given: Pressure P varies jointly as area A and cube of wind velocity V, i.e. P = k A V^3. Given that when V=8 mph, A=2 ft^2, then P=4 pounds. So then 4 = k * 2 * (8)^3. But (8)^3=512. So k = 4 / (2 *512) = 4 / 1024 = 1/256. So constant k=1/256. Then we want to find wind velocity when pressure on 4 square feet of sail is 32 pounds. So we have equation: 32 = (1/256)*4*V^3. So simplify: 32 = (4/256) * V^3 = (1/64)* V^3. So multiply both sides by 64: 32*64 = V^3, compute 32*64=2048. So V^3 = 2048, then V = cube root of 2048. Now 2048 = 2^11, so cube root of 2^11 = 2^(11/3) = 2^(3 + 2/3) = 8 * cube root of 4. Wait, but check: 8 * cube root of 4. But we can also see: cube root of 2048 equals? Let's see: 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197, so not an integer. But maybe we can simplify: 2048 = 8*256, but 8^3=512, no. Let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3.6667) which is not an integer. Alternatively, we can write it as 2^(11/3)=2^(3 +2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But maybe we can simplify further: 2^(2/3)= cube root of 4. So answer is V = 8* cube root of 4 mph. But we can also check: 8^3=512, 9^3=729, 10^3=1000, 11^3=1331, 12^3=1728, 13^3=2197. So 2048 is between 12^3 and 13^3. So answer is 2^(11/3) mph. But maybe we can simplify: cube root of 2048 = cube root of (2^11)= 2^(11/3) mph. But wait, let's check: 2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)=8*2^(2/3). But that's not a nice integer. Alternatively, maybe we can simplify: 2^(2/3)= (2^2)^(1/3)= cube root of 4, so answer is 8 cube root of 4 mph. Let me check: 8*(cube root of 4) approximates 8*1.5874=12.699. But wait, we can compute: cube root of 2048 = 12.699. But we can also check: 12.699^3 approximates 2048. So answer is 12.699 mph approximately.\n\nBut maybe the answer expects a simplified radical form: 8 cube root of 4 mph or 2^(11/3) mph. But the problem might be expecting a numeric answer in mph. But the problem said \"Find the wind velocity\", so answer: approximately 12.70 mph, or exactly 8 cube root of 4 mph.\n\nLet's check: Actually, we can also simplify: 2^(11/3)=2^(3+2/3)=8*2^(2/3)=8*(cube root of 4). So answer: wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, which is about 12.70 mph. Alternatively, we can solve: V^3 = 2048, so V = cube root of 2048. But 2048= 2^11, so V=2^(11/3)=2^(3 + 2/3)= 8*2^(2/3)= 8 cube root of 4. So answer: wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph. That is the answer.\n\nI'll now produce answer: The wind velocity is 8 cube root of 4 mph, which is approximately 12.70 mph.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in the required format: \\boxed{8\\sqrt[3]{4}} mph.
