    "input": "Let's say Alice selects a set $A$ containing positive integers. Bob then creates a comprehensive list of all finite non-empty sets $B$ of positive integers, where each set $B$ must satisfy one condition: its largest element must be a member of set $A$. If Bob's list contains exactly 2024 sets, what is the sum of all elements in set $A$?",
    "output": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\nConsider any element $k$ in Alice's set $A$. When $k$ is the maximum element of a set in Bob's list, we can form $2^{k-1}$ different sets. This is because for each number less than $k$, we have two choices: include it or not.\nTherefore, if Bob has 2024 sets in total, we need:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^n 2^{a_i - 1} = 2024$ (where $a_i$ are elements of set $A$)\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^n 2^{a_i} = 4048$\nLet's write 4048 in binary:\n4048 = $(111,111,010,000)_2$\n= $2^{11} + 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^4$\nThe powers in this binary representation (minus 1) correspond to the elements in set $A$.\nTherefore, $A = {11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4}$\nThe sum of elements in $A$ is:\n11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = $\\boxed{055}$"

    "input": "Consider a torus $T$ formed by rotating a circle of radius $3$ around an axis that lies in the circle's plane at a distance of $6$ from the circle's center (imagine a donut shape). There's also a sphere $S$ with radius $11$. When $T$ is positioned to be internally tangent to $S$, they intersect along a circle of radius $r_i$. Similarly, when $T$ is externally tangent to $S$, they intersect along a circle of radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be expressed as a fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the value of $m+n$.",
