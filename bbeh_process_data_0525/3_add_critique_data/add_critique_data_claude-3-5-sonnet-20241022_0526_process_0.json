We need to find the difference in days between these two dates.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days from 2012-Apr-05 to 2013 Jan-21. This can be broken down into the days in April 2012, the days in January 2013 up to January 21, and the days in the year 2012 from April 5 to December 31.\n\n- Days in April 2012: 30 - 5 + 1 = 26\n- Days in January 2013 up to January 21: 21\n- Days from April 5 to December 31, 2012: (30 - 5) + (31 - 0) + (31 - 0) + (30 - 0) + (31 - 0) + (31 - 0) + (30 - 0) + (31 - 0) + (31 - 0) + (30 - 0) + (31 - 0) + (31 - 0) + (31 - 0) = 25 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 31 = 276\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[ 26 + 21 + 276 = 323 \\]\n\nSo, Rachel is 323 days older than Brad.

We need to find out how many days Rachel is older than Brad.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days from Rachel's birth to the end of 2012:\n- May has 31 days, so from May-05 to May-31 is \\(31 - 5 = 26\\) days.\n- There are 12 months in a year, so from January-01 to January-21 is 21 days.\n- Therefore, the total number of days from Rachel's birth to the end of 2012 is \\(26 + 21 = 47\\) days.\n\nNext, calculate the number of days in 2013 up to Brad's birth:\n- January has 31 days, so from January-21 to January-31 is \\(31 - 21 = 10\\) days.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of days from Rachel's birth to Brad's birth is \\(47 + 10 = 57\\) days.

We need to find out how many days old Elizabeth was when William was 333 days old.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days from William's birth to the end of May:\n- May has 31 days, so from May-31 to May-31 is 0 days.\n\nNext, calculate the number of days from Elizabeth's birth to the end of May:\n- May has 31 days, so from May-17 to May-31 is \\(31 - 17 = 14\\) days.\n\nSince William was born 14 days after Elizabeth, when William is 333 days old, Elizabeth is \\(333 - 14 = 319\\) days old.

They decided to go to the same restaurant every \\(X'\\) days, which is \\(-219\\) days. Since \\(-219\\) days is equivalent to 219 days before the start date, we need to find the next positive multiple of 219 days after 07-24-2002.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days from 05-23-2002 to 07-24-2002:\n- From 05-23-2002 to 06-23-2002 is 30 days.\n- From 06-23-2002 to 07-24-2002 is 31 days.\n- Therefore, the total number of days from 05-23-2002 to 07-24-2002 is \\(30 + 11 = 41\\) days.\n\nNext, calculate the number of days from 07-24-2002 to the next time they will go to the restaurant:\n- Since they go to the restaurant every 219 days, we need to find the remainder when 219 days is subtracted from 41 days.\n- \\(219 - 41 = 178\\).\n\nTherefore, the next time they will go to the restaurant is 178 days after 07-24-2002. To find the exact date, we add 178 days to 07-24-2002:\n- Adding 178 days to 07-24-2002 gives us 07-24-2002 + 219 days = 13-01-2005.\n\nTherefore, the next time Alan and Mary will go to the restaurant is \\(\\boxed{13-01-2005}\\).",

        "solution": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the answers to Question1 and Question2, then use those answers to find the values of \\(X'\\) and \\(Y'\\), and finally use \\(X'\\) to find the next time Alan and Mary will go to the restaurant.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the answer to Question1.**\n\n question1: Rachel was born on 2012-Apr-05 and Brad was born on 2013ombie-21. How many days is Rachel older than Brad?\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days from Rachel's birth to the end of 2012:\n- April has 30 days, so from April-05 to April-30 is \\(30 - 5 + 1 = 26\\) days.\n- There are 365 days in a non-leap year, so from January-01 to December-31 is 365 days.\n- Therefore, the total number of days from April-05 to December-31 is \\(26 + 365 = 391\\) days.\n\nNext, calculate the number of days from the beginning of 2013 to Brad's birth:\n- January has 31 days, so from January-01 to January-21 is 21 days.\n- Therefore, the total number of days from January-21 to December-31 is \\(21 + 365 = 386\\) days.\n\nNow, calculate the difference in days between Rachel's birth and Brad's birth:\n- The difference is \\(391 - 21 = 365\\) days.\n\nSo, the answer to Question1 is \\(X = 146\\).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the answer to Question2.**\n\n question2: Elizabeth and William were born on 2022-May-17 and 2022CLU-31 respectively. When William was 333 days old, how old was Elizabeth in days?\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days from William's birth to the end of May:\n- May has 31 days, so from May-17 to May-31 is \\(31 - 17 + 1 = 15\\) days.\n- There are 365 days in a non-leap year, so from June-01 to December-31 is \\(365 - 15 = 350\\) days.\n- Therefore, the total number of days from May-17 to December-31 is \\(15 + 350 = 365\\) days.\n\nNext, calculate the number of days from the beginning of 2022 to William's birth:\n- January has 31 days, so from January-01 to May-17 is \\(31 + 17 = 26\\) days.\n- Therefore, the total number of days from January-01 to May-17 is \\(26 + 365 = 414\\) days.\n\nSince William is 333 days old, we need to find the date 333 days after his birth. Since 333 days is less than 414 days, it must be in May. The number of days from May-17 to William's birth is \\(414 - 333 = 81\\) days. Therefore, William was born 81 days before his 333rd day, which means he was born on May-17.\n\nNow, calculate the number of days from Elizabeth's birth to William's birth:\n- Elizabeth was born on May-17, so the difference is 0 days.\n\nTherefore, Elizabeth was 0 days old when William was 333 days old.\n\nSo, the answer to Question2 is \\(Y = 333\\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate \\(X'\\) and \\(Y'\\).**\n\n\\[X' = X - 276 = 146 - 276 = -130\\]\n\\[Y' = Y - 472 = 333 - 472 = -139\\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the next time Alan and Mary will go to the restaurant.**\n\nAlan and Mary tried the restaurant on 05-Y)-2002, which is 2002-05-05. They decided to go to the restaurant every \\(X' = -130\\) days. Since \\(-130\\) is negative, we need to find the positive equivalent by adding 365 days (the number of days in a year):\n\\[X' = 365 - 130 = 235\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the next time they will go to the restaurant after 2002-05-05. Since 235 days is less than 365 days, it will be in May. The number of days from May-05 to May-11 is 6 days. Therefore, the next time they will go to the restaurant is 2002-05-24.\n\nSo, the answer to Question3 is \\(\\boxed{07-24-2002}\\).",
