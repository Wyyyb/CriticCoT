We need to calculate the number of days between these two dates.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days from 2012-Apr-05 to 2012 Mar-31:\n- March has 31 days.\n- From April 5 to April 30 is 25 days.\n- Total days in 2012 from April 5 to March 31 is \\(31 - 5 + 1 = 26\\) days.\n\nNext, calculate the number of days in 2013 from January 1 to January 21:\n- January has 31 days.\n- From January 1 to January 21 is 21 days.\n- Total days in 2013 from January 1 to January 21 is 21 days.\n\nNow, add the days from both periods:\n\\[26 + 21 = 47\\]\n\nSo, Rachel is 47 days older than Brad.

Since a negative number of days means going backwards in time, we need to find the next positive time they will go to the restaurant by adding the absolute value of \\(X'\\) days to the current date.\n\nThe current date is 07-24-2002. Adding 229 days to this date:\n- First, calculate the number of days from 07-24-2002 to 12-31-2002:\n  - Days in July: \\(31 - 24 + 1 = 8\\)\n  - Days in August: 31\n  - Days in September: 30\n  - Days in October: 31\n  - Days in November: 30\n  - Days in December: 31\n  - Total days in 2002 from July 24 to December 31 is \\(8 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 181\\)\n- Next, calculate the remaining days needed: \\(229 - 181 = 48\\)\n- So, adding 48 days to 12-31-2002 gives us 01-04-2003.\n\nTherefore, the next time Alan and Mary will go to the restaurant is \\(\\boxed{01-04-2003}\\).",

May has 31 days, so the number of days from May 17 to May 31 is:\n\\[ 31 - 17 = 14 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNext, calculate the number of days in June, July, and August:\n\\[ 30 + 31 + 31 = 92 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nThen, calculate the number of days in October from October 1 to October 31:\n\\[ 31 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNow, add these together to get the total number of days between May 17 and October 31:\n\\[ 14 + 92 + 31 = 137 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSince William was born on October 31, he is 137 days older than Elizabeth. Therefore, when William was 333 days old, Elizabeth was:\n\\[ 333 - 137 = 196 \\text{ days old} \\]\n\nSo, \\(Y = 196\\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate \\(X'\\) and \\(Y'\\)**\n\nGiven:\n\\[ X' = X - 276 \\]\n\\[ Y' = Y - 472 \\]\n\nSubstitute the values of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\):\n\\[ X' = 66 - 276 = -210 \\]\n\\[ Y' = 196 - 472 = -276 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the next time Alan and Mary will go to the restaurant**\n\nAlan and Mary tried the restaurant on 05-Y' - 2002, which is:\n\\[ 05 - (-276) - 2002 = 05 + 276 - 2002 = 281 - 2002 = 2007 \\]\n\nThey go to the restaurant every \\(X'\\) days, which is -210 days. Since -210 days is equivalent to 210 days before the starting date, we need to find the next time after 2007 that is a multiple of 210 days after 07-24-2002.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days from 07-24-2002 to 281-2007:\n\\[ 2007 - 2002 = 5 \\text{ years} \\]\n\\[ 5 \\text{ years} = 5 \\times 365 = 1825 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nThen, add the days from 07-24-2002 to 281-2007:\n\\[ 1825 + (281 - 24) = 1825 + 257 = 2082 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNext, find the next multiple of 210 days after 2082:\n\\[ 2082 \\div 210 \\approx 9.914 \\]\nThe integer part of the division is 9, so the next multiple of 210 is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 210 = 2100 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the number of days from 2082 to 2100:\n\\[ 2100 - 2082 = 18 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSo, the next time Alan and Mary will go to the restaurant is 18 days after 07-24-2007:\n\\[ 07-24-2007 + 18 \\text{ days} = 07-42-2007 \\]\n\nSince 42 days in August is August 13:\n\\[ 07-42-2007 = 07-14-2008 \\]\n\nTherefore, the next time Alan and Mary will go to the restaurant is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{07-14-2008}\n\\]",

We need to find out how many days Rachel is older than Brad.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days from 2012-Apr-05 to the end of 2012:\n- April has 30 days, so from April 5 to April 30 is \\(30 - 5 + 1 = 26\\) days.\n- Since 2012 is a leap year, February has 29 days. From January 1 to February 29 is \\(29\\) days.\n- From March 1 to March 31 is \\(31\\) days.\n- From April 1 to April 30 is \\(30\\) days.\n- From May 1 to May 31 is \\(31\\) days.\n- From June 1 to June 30 is \\(30\\) days.\n- From July 1 to July 31 is \\(31\\) days.\n- From August 1 to August 31 is \\(31\\) days.\n- From September 1 to September 31 is \\(30\\) days.\n- From October 1 to October 31 is \\(31\\) days.\n- From November 1 to November 30 is \\(30\\) days.\n- From December 1 to December 31 is \\(31\\) days.\n\nAdding these up, we get:\n\\[26 + 29 + 31 + 22 + 15 + 19 + 17 + 27 + 23 + 18 + 20 + 26 = 341\\]\nSo, from January 1 to April 5, 2012, there are 91 days.\n\nNext, calculate the number of days from January 1 to January 21, 2013:\n- January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 21 is \\(21\\) days.\n\nAdding these up, we get:\n\\[91 + 31 = 124\\]\nSo, from April 5, 2012, to January 21, 2013, there are \\(1225 - 124 = 1017\\) days.\n\nTherefore, Rachel is \\(\\boxed{7}\\) days older than Brad.\n\n**Step 2: Solve Question2**\n\nElizabeth was born on 2022-May-17 and William was born on 2022-May-31.

Therefore, to be 333 days old, he needed to be born 15 days before May 17, which is from May 31 to May 17 is \\(333 - 15 = 318\\) days.\n\nNext, calculate how many days Elizabeth was when William was 333 days old:\n- From May 17 to May 17 is 0 days.\n- From May 17 to May 31 is 15 days.\n\nTherefore, Elizabeth was \\(\\boxed{324}\\) days old when William was 333 days old.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate \\(X'\\) and \\(Y'\\)**\n\nUsing the values from Question1 and Question2, we get:\n\\[X' = X - 276 = 7 - 276 = -275\\]\n\\[Y' = Y - 472 = 324 - 472 = -148\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve Question3**\n\nAlan and Mary tried a new restaurant on 05-Y'-2002 and really liked it.
