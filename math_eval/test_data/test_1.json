Substitute \\(y = x^2\\) into the equation \\(x + y = 1\\).\n2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation for \\(x\\).\n3. Find the corresponding \\(y\\) values for each \\(x\\).\n4. Calculate the distance between the two points of intersection.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step in Python using sympy.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = sp.symbols('x y')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = y - x**2\neq2 = x + y - 1\n\n# Substitute y = x^2 into x + y = 1\nsubstituted_eq = eq2.subs(y, x**2)\nsolutions_x = sp.solve(substituted_eq, x)\n\n# Find the corresponding y values\npoints = [(x_val, x_val**2) for x_val in solutions_x]\n\n# Calculate the distance between the two points\npoint1, point2 = points\ndistance = sp.sqrt((point1[0] - point2[0])**2 + (point1[1] - point2[1])**2)\n\n# Simplify the distance\ndistance_simplified = sp.simplify(distance)\nprint(distance_simplified)\n```\n```output\nsqrt(10)\n```\nThe distance between the two intersections of the curves \\(y = x^2\\) and \\(x + y = 1\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}\\).", "pred": "", "task": "math", "is_correct": "incorrect"}
